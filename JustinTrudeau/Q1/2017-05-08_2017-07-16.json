          "bodyText": "Late-night hosts discussed Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Paris, where he was ridiculed for the way he greeted Brigitte Macron. \u201cDonald Trump is in France right now, and I feel je ne sais quoi, if you know what I mean,\u201d Stephen Colbert began. \u201cI don\u2019t, because I don\u2019t speak French.\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cI don\u2019t blame Donald Trump for skipping town \u2013 the man has had a really rough week. His son admitted to colluding with Russia. His healthcare plan is looking dead in the water. And his press secretary still has his head stuck in that honey pot. So Trump is now in Paris, and he\u2019s going to be so disappointed once he learns that oui oui doesn\u2019t mean what he thinks it does.\u201d Colbert went on to address Trump\u2019s awkward interaction with Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president. With Melania Trump and Emmanuel Macron standing by, Trump told the French first lady she was \u201cin great physical shape\u201d, adding that she was \u201cbeautiful\u201d. \u201cToday Trump met France\u2019s first lady Brigitte Macron, and of course he treated her like any other woman \u2013 by objectifying her,\u201d Colbert said, telling Trump: \u201cThis is not one of your European wife-shopping trips. This is business. And the man has got to learn his limits.\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cThen Trump held a joint press conference with newly elected French president and somehow-hotter Justin Trudeau Emmanuel Macron. Trump invoked America\u2019s long history with France.\u201d At the press conference, Trump suggested that \u201cnot a lot of people know\u201d about the two country\u2019s historic alliance. \u201cNope, just you,\u201d Colbert joked. \u201cWe know. Gave us the Statue of Liberty, too. Remember that part?\u201d Trevor Noah of Comedy Central discussed Trump\u2019s trip to France and the president\u2019s interview with Pat Robertson, in which he continued to blame Hillary Clinton for various things. \u201cAfter a week-long tirade on Twitter, President Trump last night finally decided to speak with words to an actual human being about the rumors of Russian collusion,\u201d Noah began. \u201cI say human being, but it was actually conservative pastor and Jeff Sessions\u2019 troll cousin Pat Robertson.\u201d In the interview, Trump said that Vladimir Putin had actually wanted Hillary Clinton to emerge victorious in the presidential election. \u201cHere we go again,\u201d the host said. \u201cHillary is behind everything that\u2019s going wrong. Trump is like political Hodor.\u201d Noah went on: \u201cSo, the new conspiracy theory is that Putin actually wanted Hillary to win. And that\u2019s why he colluded with Trump Jr? There is no problem President Trump can\u2019t blame on Hillary. He\u2019ll be in bed, like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe Hillary couldn\u2019t get it up tonight.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s trip to Hamburg for the G20 saw Trump frozen out by many of his international partners while he continued to baffle observers with his eagerness to give Russia the benefit of the doubt on election hacking. The Guardian said the US president \u201cseemed so out of step with the rest of the world that it was a case of the \u2018G1\u2019 versus the \u2018G19\u2019\u201d. The New York Times said the trip had chiefly been \u201cwelcome respite from the forever wars in Washington\u201d. And the Washington Post said the visit proved Trump was still \u201can unpredictable force on the world stage and an outlier among longtime American partners\u201d. But for Trump himself it was clear that the only way to truly sum up his second foreign trip was with a two-minute web video soundtracked by a choir belting out his campaign slogan over triumphant martial brass. \u201cMake America great again/ Make America great again / Lift the torch of freedom/ All across the land,\u201d the song begins, as pictures of Trump greeting Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, Narendra Modi and other world leaders fly past in a style familiar to anyone who has used Apple\u2019s iMovie. There is room for plenty of shots of his wife and daughter (who helped make the summit great herself), and even a couple near the end of his controversial meeting with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s not the first song to turn Trump\u2019s catchphrase \u2013 adapted from Ronald Reagan \u2013 into a stirring anthem. Delegates at last year\u2019s Republican convention in Cleveland were treated to a rousing country-rock anthem on the same theme. But although this choral version is less catchy, the almost Germanic sound of this song is at least appropriate to the summit\u2019s location. And perhaps to the message of cultural nationalism he expounded in Poland.",

US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Trump was \u201crightly focused on how do we move forward\u201d from the issue, while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov even claimed Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader\u2019s denials of involvement.</p> <p>Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections \u2013 as Tillerson said had been agreed \u2013 is hardly likely to reassure those in Washington worried about Russia\u2019s actions.</p> <p>A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for Putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when Lavrov <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/15/donald-trump-shared-classified-information-russia-white-house-report\">visited</a> the White House in May and it later emerged that Trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the Russians.</p> <p>The personalised format of the meeting excluded those in Trump\u2019s team who are more sceptically minded on Russia, such as national security adviser HR McMaster, and Trump\u2019s senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, a longstanding Russia expert.</p> <p>Russian television emphasised the length of the meeting, which ran more than four times over its scheduled half-hour length, as a sign of Russia\u2019s importance. The news of a US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, announced as the meeting was ongoing, is an example of the kind of top-table diplomacy Putin would like to do with Trump.</p> <p>Putin looked impassive, but he would have been smiling inside. As journalists were hurried out of the room, Putin <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASLuhn/status/883372352171585537\">appeared</a> to gesture to Trump and ask if these journalists were the ones who had insulted Trump, laughing at his own joke.</p> <p>Presumably Putin had been briefed that a disdain for supposed \u201cfake news\u201d would be a promising area of potential common ground with the US president.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-595fd30be4b0e63a4a77f4fa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/philip-oltermann\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-07T18:32:14.562Z\">7.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Arrests and injuries as Hamburg gripped by mass anti-G20 protests</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A day of violent clashes between police and protesters culminated on Friday evening with the bizarre spectacle of the heads of the world\u2019s 20 leading economies listening to Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy at the top of a shiny high-rise building while police used water cannons, teargas and speed boats to keep at bay an angry crowd of thousands.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s second-largest city had been eager to showcase its recently opened Elbphilharmonie concert hall to the rest of the world, but it may came to rue its ivory-tower symbolism after a week of chaotic scenes on the edges of the conference hall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5b32eee8780c2a59df62766a01ec737575ebd5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5b32eee8780c2a59df62766a01ec737575ebd5b/0_158_5050_3031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters sit in front of police water cannon vehicles during the G20 summit in Hamburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters sit in front of police water cannon vehicles during the G20 summit in Hamburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carsten Koall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rising tensions between protesters and police had escalated with clashes in Hamburg\u2019s historic harbour area on Thursday night, and escalated further when masked anti-capitalist protesters torched cars and smashed shop windows in the Altona district on Friday morning.</p> <p>Masked protesters in black clothes used flares to set fire to at least 20 cars and pelted rocks at the windows of banks and smaller shops as they made their way through Altona and along the Elbchaussee road along the river at about 7.30 am on Friday morning.</p> <p>Many shops and cafes in the area, including a local Ikea, boarded up their windows in anticipation of further rioting.</p> <p>Melania Trump, the wife of the US president, Donald Trump, was reportedly stopped from attending an event in the G20\u2019s supporting programme by the protests. \u201cPolice have not given us security clearance to leave the guest house,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesperson told German press agency dpa.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/07/g20-protests-hamburg-altona-messehalle\">Arrests and injuries as Hamburg gripped by mass anti-G20 protests</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-595fd21ce4b0d920e0e29f9b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/anushkaasthana\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-07T18:28:37.626Z\">7.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May raises North Korea in meeting with Chinese president</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Politics editor Anushka Asthana is at the summit: </p> <p>Theresa May has had a 30-minute bilateral meeting with China\u2019s Xi Jinping in which she raised questions over North Korea and steel-dumping, but also talked of a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations between the two countries. </p> <p>A senior No 10 official said the session began with the president saying that Chinese investment into Britain had increased since the Brexit vote, and that was a sign of confidence in the country. </p> <p>\u201cHe said that Brexit was a very big event for the world but that he believed a prosperous and stable and open UK and prosperous and stable and open EU would be positive for the world and that China would work to further promote its interests with Britain and with the European Union,\u201d they said. </p> <p>May said that as the UK got ready to leave the EU it wanted to build on trade agreements with other countries, including China.

But what I\u2019m doing here at the G20 is raising the need for us to work collectively internationally to deal with terrorist financing.\u201d </p> <p>That sounds like the prime minister is not likely to be raising any direct questions with the Saudi representative \u2013 and despite heavy pressure, the government still has not published the home office report into this issue.</p> <p>Pushed on climate change, after the UK did not sign up to a letter with the leaders of France, Germany and Italy expressing their disappointment at Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, May said she was disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cI hope they will be able to find a way to come back into the Paris agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it is possible. We are not renegotiating the Paris agreement. That stays,\u201d she added - firming up her language on this point.</p> <p>On domestic matters, she said the election had not ended up as she hoped but: \u201cThere\u2019s two ways the government can react to that. We can be very timid and sit back or we can be bold and that\u2019s what we are going to be.\u201d</p> <p>And on intimidation of candidates raised by a number of Tory MPs, including Sarah Wollaston in an interview with the Guardian, she said: \u201cThere can be no place in our democracy for behaviour like that.

By this I mean asset freezes and travel bans, it is the very minimum that can be done at global level.

Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin shared a convivial meeting in which Trump seems to have confronted Putin about tampering in the US election, which Putin denied. The White House wants to \u201cmove forward\u201d from the hacking accusations and accepts \u201cintractable disagreement\u201d with Russia on the matter, US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said later. Trump and Putin \u201cconnected very quickly\u201d, Tillerson said afterward. \u201cThere was a very clear positive chemistry between the two.\u201d The two sides talked about counter-terrorism, cyber-crime, election tampering, Syria, Ukraine and more in a meeting that went nearly 140 minutes \u2013 almost two hours longer than planned. The US and Russia announced a ceasefire in southern Syria, where conflict activity has varied over the last two years. Trump and Putin, whose regime is implicated in the murder of journalists, shared a chuckle about conflict with the media. Putin seemed in a good position to claim a win from the outing. German chancellor Angela Merkel said there had been \u201cvery difficult\u201d talks on trade. British prime minister Theresa May spoke about possible future trade deals with counterparts including Japan, China and others. Read our politics Minute roundup of the day\u2019s events. Read our coverage of mass protests in Hamburg: Great flowers on that table. The stadium of Hamburg\u2019s football club FC St Pauli is right in the heart of the district where many of this week\u2019s clashes between protesters and police have taken place. The club, whose supporters have a reputation around the world for their leftwing and countercultural politics, has even offered up its stadium as a shelter for protesters during the G20 summit. St Pauli\u2019s technical director Ewald Lienen told The Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent Philip Oltermann of his concerns about the escalating situation in the city: Dinnertime. Image via CSPAN: As they leaned deeply towards one another in Hamburg, it was all too easy to see and hear the similarities between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Trump said it was \u201can honor\u201d to be with Putin, who gushed that he was \u201cdelighted to meet\u201d Trump. \u201cWe look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia and for the United States and for everybody concerned,\u201d Trump offered. You can only wonder at the scale of conservative outrage if Barack Obama had hoped first for Russian happiness, and second for American success. \u201cAmerica first\u201d takes second place when Vladimir is sitting close to Donald. \u201cWe spoke over the phone with you several times,\u201d Putin replied. \u201cBut phone conversations are never enough, definitely.\u201d How true. In any long-distance relationship, you need something more physical to make it real. Along with a team of collaborators with curiously close ties throughout a big election and its aftermath. It\u2019s tempting to think that Trump and Putin are cut from the same cloth. They both like to style themselves as strongmen... Read the full piece: There have been no reports that Trump mentioned the Russian takeover of Crimea in his meeting with Putin. On Thursday Trump accused Russia of \u201cdestabilizing activities\u201d in Ukraine and elsewhere. Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker writes: Vladimir Putin is likely to count the format and tone of his long meeting with Donald Trump as a win \u2013 even if nothing much of substance was discussed. Russia\u2019s election hacking was raised during the meeting, but it does not appear to have taken top billing. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Trump was \u201crightly focused on how do we move forward\u201d from the issue, while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov even claimed Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader\u2019s denials of involvement. Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections \u2013 as Tillerson said had been agreed \u2013 is hardly likely to reassure those in Washington worried about Russia\u2019s actions. A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for Putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when Lavrov visited the White House in May and it later emerged that Trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the Russians. The personalised format of the meeting excluded those in Trump\u2019s team who are more sceptically minded on Russia, such as national security adviser HR McMaster, and Trump\u2019s senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, a longstanding Russia expert. Russian television emphasised the length of the meeting, which ran more than four times over its scheduled half-hour length, as a sign of Russia\u2019s importance. The news of a US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, announced as the meeting was ongoing, is an example of the kind of top-table diplomacy Putin would like to do with Trump. Putin looked impassive, but he would have been smiling inside. As journalists were hurried out of the room, Putin appeared to gesture to Trump and ask if these journalists were the ones who had insulted Trump, laughing at his own joke. Presumably Putin had been briefed that a disdain for supposed \u201cfake news\u201d would be a promising area of potential common ground with the US president. A day of violent clashes between police and protesters culminated on Friday evening with the bizarre spectacle of the heads of the world\u2019s 20 leading economies listening to Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy at the top of a shiny high-rise building while police used water cannons, teargas and speed boats to keep at bay an angry crowd of thousands. Germany\u2019s second-largest city had been eager to showcase its recently opened Elbphilharmonie concert hall to the rest of the world, but it may came to rue its ivory-tower symbolism after a week of chaotic scenes on the edges of the conference hall. Rising tensions between protesters and police had escalated with clashes in Hamburg\u2019s historic harbour area on Thursday night, and escalated further when masked anti-capitalist protesters torched cars and smashed shop windows in the Altona district on Friday morning. Masked protesters in black clothes used flares to set fire to at least 20 cars and pelted rocks at the windows of banks and smaller shops as they made their way through Altona and along the Elbchaussee road along the river at about 7.30 am on Friday morning. Many shops and cafes in the area, including a local Ikea, boarded up their windows in anticipation of further rioting. Melania Trump, the wife of the US president, Donald Trump, was reportedly stopped from attending an event in the G20\u2019s supporting programme by the protests. \u201cPolice have not given us security clearance to leave the guest house,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesperson told German press agency dpa. Read further: Politics editor Anushka Asthana is at the summit: Theresa May has had a 30-minute bilateral meeting with China\u2019s Xi Jinping in which she raised questions over North Korea and steel-dumping, but also talked of a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations between the two countries. A senior No 10 official said the session began with the president saying that Chinese investment into Britain had increased since the Brexit vote, and that was a sign of confidence in the country. \u201cHe said that Brexit was a very big event for the world but that he believed a prosperous and stable and open UK and prosperous and stable and open EU would be positive for the world and that China would work to further promote its interests with Britain and with the European Union,\u201d they said. May said that as the UK got ready to leave the EU it wanted to build on trade agreements with other countries, including China. The official added: \u201cThe prime minister said because the countries have such a strong relationship they can discuss the areas in which they have differences.\u201d In particular, she talked about overproduction of steel, and said she wanted China to put more pressure on North Korea. White House aides sent Melania Trump into the Putin-Trump meeting around the 80-minute mark to try to break it up, but the meeting went on for another hour, Tillerson said, AP reports: \u201cThere was so much to talk about,\u201d said Tillerson. \u201cNeither one of them wanted to stop.\u201d He added that at one point, aides sent in first lady Melania Trump to try to wrap up the talks, but the meeting went on another hour after that, \u201cso clearly she failed.\u201d It\u2019s unclear when Putin and Trump will meet again, Tillerson says. Watch Putin confidentially lean in to Trump, stick his thumb at the media and ask about Trump\u2019s problems with the press: Here\u2019s further language from Tillerson, this time via CBS News, in which the secretary of state indicates that the White House wishes to move quickly past Russia\u2019s flat denial of election tampering, which contradicts US intelligence assessments (and which tampering is at the center of multiple ongoing congressional and justice department investigations which could implicate people around the president or possibly the president): More from the Tillerson news conference: The conference is off camera, but here White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweets a picture: The declassified version from January of the US intelligence report assessing Russian tampering in the US election is here. Tillerson has told reporters that a working group would be set up to establish a framework agreement on cyber-crime and non-interference in elections, Reuters reports. Tillerson further touted the southern Syria ceasefire agreement as a watershed moment of cooperation, Bloomberg reports: Further details of the agreement per Tillerson via Bloomberg: A \u201cde-escalation agreement\u201d was agreed to by US, Russia and Jordan regarding ceasefire in southwest Syria, Tillerson tells press in Germany. Russia\u2019s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov confirms a ceasefire in southwest Syria will begin Sunday, July 9 at noon. Tillerson said he thinks Trump \u201cis rightly focused on how do we move forward from something that may be an intractable disagreement at this point,\u201d the AP reports. The \u201cintractable disagreement\u201d being conflicting Russian and US views on who tampered with the US election. The Russian side says Trump accepted Putin\u2019s denial of tampering. US intelligence agencies have warned that Russia will keep up efforts to interfere in US and other elections, and that a failure to acknowledge the tampering makes the United States more vulnerable to future tampering. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that Trump had accepted Putin\u2019s denial of tampering in the US election. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson, however, offered a different picture. He told reporters that it was not clear whether the two countries would ever come to a resolution on the question of election interference. Tillerson said that Trump had pressed Putin more than once about Russian involvement in election tampering, and Putin denied Russian tampering. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker with more on Lavrov\u2019s statement: An unusually irritable Sergei Lavrov took questions from the Russian media. It sounded like there had been few major breakthroughs. The most interesting part was his claim that Trump had told Putin he found it \u201cstrange\u201d that there was a \u201ccampaign\u201d over alleged Russian hacking in the election as there has been no proof. Lavrov claims Trump told Putin he had heard his entreaties that Russia did not hack the election and accepts them. That\u2019s at odds with Rex Tillerson\u2019s account of a fundamental disagreement. Both US secretary of state Rex Tillerson and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov have said that Putin denied Russian tampering in the US election. AP reports simply that Tillerson said that Putin denied a Moscow role: The Russian minister reports that Trump accepted Putin\u2019s version of events. CNN reports that secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who was in the Putin meeting, said Trump \u201cpressed Putin more than once\u201d about election tampering. Here\u2019s the network\u2019s Jeff Zeleny: Trump and Putin acknowledged cyber threats and interference in elections, Secretary Tillerson says. \u201cVery robust and lengthy exchange.\u201d Here\u2019s NBC with a similar report: NEW (pt 2): Tillerson says @POTUS pressed Putin on more than one occasion about election interference (!!) Says Putin again denied it. Putin went straight from meeting Trump to talks with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. He apologised for his lateness due to the talks with Trump overrunning, and in opening remarks reported by Interfax, Putin said he and Trump had discussed \u201cUkraine, Syria, and other bilateral problems. We returned to the problems of fighting terrorism and cybersecurity\u201d. It\u2019s evening concert time for Trump and other G20 attendees (Hamburg is six hours ahead of New York). The Russian Interfax news agency advises that Putin says he and Trump discussed Syria, Ukraine, the fight against terrorism and cyber crime, Reuters reports. No readout yet from the US side. Is that the camera catching Angela Merkel incidentally looking up, or is this an epic eye roll? Merkel has a solid repertoire of understated facial expressions for navigating awkward moments with overbearing counterparts. Viz.: Fighting in the southern Syrian province of Daraa has recently picked up despite a nominal ceasefire. In June the Assad regime and its Russian allies began a campaign of aerial bombardment that observers speculated was a prelude to a broader operation to wrest control of the province, which sits by the Jordanian border. For most of the past two years, the southern front had been quieter than other parts of Syria as the rebels\u2019 backers \u2013 based in Jordan \u2013 limited their support. The Syrian army had already announced a ceasefire earlier this week already \u2013 and several times before \u2013 but violence has continued and the opposition said those announcements are ruses aimed at getting them to join peace talks. The Russian-American announcement seems to indicate that this time there will be superpower backing for a ceasefire that Moscow and its Syrian allies had previously violated. The Trump-Putin meeting is indeed over, the travelling US press pool cites an unnamed state department official as saying. Note to readers: this is Tom McCarthy in New York taking over for Jon Henley. Russian TV reports that the bilateral meeting has concluded after 140 minutes. The Trump-Putin meeting has passed the two-hour mark, according to timepieces on the scene kept by CNN and NBC. Has Trump found time to bring up Russia\u2019s attempts to wreck the US presidential election, from hacking emails belonging to the Clinton campaign and Democratic party, to disseminating false news stories, to an apparently oceanic phishing scheme, to tampering with voter rolls \u2013 to possibly colluding with US political operatives? In the US on Friday, intelligence and justice officials have been decrying Trump\u2019s refusal to state unequivocally, as US intelligence agencies have, that Moscow was behind the election tampering. Sally Yates is the former acting attorney general fired by Trump for her refusal of his travel ban: James Clapper is the former director of national intelligence: The Associated press is citing US officials as saying the US and Russia have reached an agreement for a ceasefire in southwest Syria to take effect on 9 July at noon Damascus time. The news came as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were continuing their talk at the G20 summit in Hamburg. AP said the officials spoke on condition of anonymity. The deal marks a new level of US involvement in trying to resolve Syria\u2019s civil war. The two countries have backed opposing sides in the war. According to US broadcaster NBC, citing pool reports, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are still talking: President Trump and President Putin are still talking 90 minutes into meeting, per pool. They had originally been scheduled for 30 minutes. Germany\u2019s justice minister, Heiko Maas, has condemned the violent clashes at the summit that have left 160 police officers injured and seen more than 40 protesters arrested. \u201cEvery peaceful protest is welcome,\u201d Maas told the daily Bild. \u201cBut that is no free pass for unrestrained rampage ... These extremist criminals don\u2019t belong in the streets, but in court. Whoever torches cars and injures police officers does not deserve any kind of tolerance.\u201d Separately, the Hamburg fire department said 11 protesters had been severely injured and were in hospital fell off a wall during confrontations with police. Angela Merkel has said in remarks to reporters at the Hamburg summit that it had so far produced \u201cvery difficult\u201d discussions on trade. The German chancellor said negotiators \u201cstill have a great deal of work ahead of them\u201d to reach an agreed passage on trade in the summit\u2019s closing communique, adding that most participants called for \u201cfree but also fair trade\u201d and underlined the significance of the World Trade Organisation. Concerns about Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach have dominated trade talks at the G20 meeting. Merkel the discussions were \u201cvery difficult, I don\u2019t want to beat about the bush with that.\u201d The German chancellor added that \u201cmost\u201d of the G20 participants had backed the Paris climate accord, and described the violent protests in the city as unacceptable. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called on G20 members to champion an open world economy, strengthen economic policy coordination and forestall risks in financial markets, Reuters reports. Citing the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Reuters said Xi also urged member states to follow a \u201cmultilateral trade regime\u201d amid concerns over mounting protectionist pressures, including from Donald Trump\u2019s US administration. \u201cWe must remain committed to openness and mutual benefit for all so as to increase the size of the global economic \u2018pie\u2019,\u201d Xi was quoted as saying. The world\u2019s economy was still troubled by deep-seated problems and faces many uncertainties and destabilising factors, he added. Xi had already offered a vigorous defence of globalisation and signalled Beijing\u2019s desire to play a bigger role on the world stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January. This almost professionally shot video, uploaded to YouTube today, gives some idea of what the Hamburg protests must feel and look like from the perspective of the hardcore \u201cBlack Block\u201d protesters: A little light relief? Caption competitions for photographs of world leaders at the Hamburg summit are doing the rounds on Twitter. Here\u2019s a fine entry from writer and Guardian night team member Simon Ricketts: Guardian political editor Anushka Asthana, who is travelling with Theresa May, has news of the prime minister\u2019s bilateral meeting with Italy\u2019s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, to discuss the migration crisis in the Mediterranean: \u201cThe two leaders agreed that a team from Home Office and DFID will travel to Italy to offer expertise on processing papers and other documents to allow migrants to be returned to their source country,\u201d a Downing street spokeswoman said. \u201cThey also committed to work together to tackle the problem upstream. They will work together on how best to spend \u00a375million pledged by DFID to help migrants making the journey from Africa to the central Mediterranean route.\u201d The government has announced some of the money will be made available to fund voluntary returns home for migrants. The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has a slightly fuller account of the long-awaited first meeting between Trump and Putin. The brief conversation in front of reporters took place just before the two withdrew for private talks: Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had some very, very good talks. We\u2019re going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue. We look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia and for the United States and for everyone concerned.\u201d Speaking through a translator, Putin said: \u201cWe spoke over the phone... but phone conversations are never enough, definitely. \u201cIf you want to have a positive outcome in bilaterals and be able to resolve most international policy issues, that will really need personal meetings. I\u2019m delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr President. And I hope, as you have said, our meeting will yield positive result.\u201d Trump did not respond to repeated shouted questions about whether he would raise the politically toxic issue of Russian hacking of the Novemver 2016 presidential election. The leaders of the US, Japan and South Korea have condemned North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile test this week as a \u201cmajor escalation\u201d and promised to apply \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to counter Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear threat. The launch was \u201ca major escalation that directly violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and that clearly demonstrates the growing threat\u201d North Korea poses, the three countries said in a joint statement. \u201cPresident Trump reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to defend the ROK (Republic of Korea) and Japan using the full range of its conventional and nuclear capabilities,\u201d they added. The Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, Philip Oltermann, has more on allegations by the Hamburg protest organisers of police provocation: Organisers of Thursday evening\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d protest march accuse German police of having knowingly risked escalating the volatile situation in the city by applying undue force against peaceful marchers. Andreas Beuth, a lawyer who had co-organised the march at a riverside plaza used for Hamburg\u2019s weekly fish market, contradicted police claims members of the march\u2019s \u201cblack bloc\u201d had refused to remove their masks on police orders, after which police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowds. \u201cThe escalation was clearly started by the police\u201d, Beuth told a press conference on Friday morning. He said many protesters had started to lower their scarves when the police began to pile indiscriminately into the back of the march, thus breaking up what could have otherwise remained a peaceful demonstration. Christoph Kleine, one of the organisers of Saturday\u2019s G20 Not Welcome march, said police had \u201crisked the loss of human life\u201d by aiming water throwers at people standing on bridges and rooftops. Protest organisers said three participants of the march had been seriously injured and one person remained in a critical condition, while several others had sustained lighter injuries during the skirmishes. Another organiser said that 14 people had had to be taken to hospital. A number of journalists working for leftwing German newspapers reported on Friday that their press accreditation had been withdrawn from them without an explanation. You can read Philip\u2019s full story on the day\u2019s protests here. Donald Trump\u2019s first meeting as US president with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is under way. Reuters reports that the US leader told Putin \u201cIt is an honour to be with you\u201d and Putin replied: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to meet you personally, and I hope our meeting will bring results.\u201d Phone conversations were \u201cnever enough\u201d, he added. Trump refused to answer a shouted question about Russian meddling in the US presidential election, but told Putin: \u201cWe look forward to a lot of positive things happening for Russia and the US.\u201d The encounter is being closely watched: the two men disagree strongly on foreign policy areas including Syria, Ukraine and North Korea and Trump on Thursday accused Russia of acting as a destabilising force. US intelligence officials have also repeatedly said Putin directed a major hacking operation to tip the November 2016 presidential election Trump\u2019s way, something Trump has been reluctant to directly acknowledge. Their first sit-down meeting is expected to last for about 30 minutes. South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-in has said he is in favour of dialogue with North Korea despite the \u201cnuclear provocation\u201d of its test launch this week of what Pyongyang said was a nuclear-capable intercontinental missile, Reuters reports. Speaking after a meeting with Vladimir Putin, Moon also said he saw a role for Putin in helping de-escalate the crisis on the Korean peninsula. Putin warned all parties involved against losing self-control, urging a \u201cpragmatic, accurate\u201d approach to its missile programme. Here is some more seriously scary video footage of masked, black-clad protesters, shot this time from inside a Hamburg bus on the Elbchaussee and posted by the city public transport authority: Die Welt reports that police have arrested leftwing extremists from France, the Netherlands and Switzerland during the protests in Hamburg, while other foreign militants travelling to the port city by train and plane have been turned back at the border. The paper said police reinforcements had been sent to Hamburg from around the country, including 200 officers from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, more than 200 from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and 300 from Berlin. City police chief Ralf Martin Meyer told reporters that tight security around the conference area had caused protesters to fan out around Hamburg, forcing police to request 900-1,000 further officers as reinforcements. \u201cWe are focusing on securing corridors to make sure that the path for (leaders\u2019) convoys is clear,\u201d Meyer said. The leaders\u2019 partners\u2019 programme for the day has been amended because of ongoing protests around the city, German media report. Hosted by Angela Merkel\u2019s husband Joachim Sauer, the programme kicked off with a boat trip around Hamburg harbour that the US first lady, Melania Trump, had to skip because she was prevented by demonstrators from leaving her guesthouse. This afternoon\u2019s planned visit to a climate research centre has been scrapped and replaced with a presentation by climate scientists at a luxury Hamburg hotel. Donald Trump and the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, have met at the G20 in Hamburg in their first face-to-face encounter since Trump became president. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be with my friend the president of Mexico,\u201d the US leader said. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he hoped to continue a \u201cflowing dialogue\u201d with his US counterpart. The Mexican leader had planned an early visit to Trump\u2019s White House but cancelled over Trump\u2019s insistence that Mexico pay for the border wall he promised during his election campaign to deter illegal Mexican immigration. Trump has since repeatedly insisted the wall will get built, and said on Friday that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d wants Mexico to pay for it. Pe\u00f1a Nieto insists Mexico will not. Here\u2019s the official summit photograph, with Angela Merkel in the front row long with Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Emmanuel Macron and Trump. Theresa May is in the second row. 1) French President Emmanuel Macron 2) US President Donald Trump 3) Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo 4) Mexico\u2019s President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto 5) South African President Jacob Zuma 6) Argentina\u2019s President Mauricio Macri 7) German chancellor Angela Merkel 8) Chinese president Xi Jinping 9) Russian President Vladimir Putin 10) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan 11) Brazilian President Michel Temer 12) South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in 13) Alpha Cond\u00e9, president of Guinea 14) Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni 15) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 16) India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi 17) Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 18) Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull 19) Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May 20) European council President Donald Tusk 21) European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker 22) UN Secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres 23) Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Erna Solberg 24) Senegal\u2019s President Macky Sall 25) Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong 26) Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc 27) World Trade Organization (WTO) Director Roberto Azev\u00eado 28) Tedros Adhanom, DG of the World Health Organization (WHO) 29) Netherlands\u2019 Prime Minister Mark Rutte 30) International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde 31) International Labour Organization (ILO) Director Guy Ryder 32) Jim Yong Kim, World Bank president of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 33) Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy 34) Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney 35) Saudi Arabia Minister of State Ibrahim Abdulaziz Al-Assaf 36) Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) Secretary Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda Following reports that an armoured vehicle from the Bundeswehr \u2013 the German army \u2013 was seen heading in the direction of Altona, the upmarket Hamburg district where Molotov cocktails have been thrown at police and many cars set alight, the city police have denied calling in military backup. The police tweet says the force is not receiving military support, which would breach the constitutional limits under which it operates. Der Spiegel reports that the military vehicles were being used by the police with prior agreement to transport necessary crowd control material such as barbed wire. After a brief break for my lunch, I can reveal what the leaders of the world\u2019s major economies are having for theirs. The menu, courtesy of Anushka Asthana, is apparently smoked fish, chilled soup and cottage cheese followed by chicken fricassee, crayfish and black rice, with fruit for dessert. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has told the G20 summit\u2019s leaders in her official welcome speech that millions of people are hoping that they can make a contribution to solving the world\u2019s problems. Merkel said she was sure every leader present would make an effort to achieve \u201cgood results\u201d, but added that \u201csolutions can only be found if we are ready to compromise\u201d. Speaking at the start of a working lunch at which the leaders will discuss global growth and trade, Merkel nonetheless said the leaders should not be reluctant to identify and address their differences. The chancellor\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, tweeted footage of the event: The diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has a fuller take on this morning\u2019s press conference by the EU council and commission presidents Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, in which they warned that the bloc would impose counter-measures \u201cwithin days\u201d if Donald Trump took action to protect the US steel industry: In one of the most serious warnings of a tit-for-tat response if the US resorts to protectionist measures, Juncker said the EU was \u201cin elevated battle mood\u201d. Targets could include American whiskey exports. Speaking at the start of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Juncker said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you in detail what we\u2019re doing. But what I would like to tell you is that within a few days \u2013 we won\u2019t need two months for that \u2013 we could react with counter-measures. I am telling you this in the hope that all of this won\u2019t be necessary. But we are in an elevated battle mood.\u201d The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, has already said she is \u201cextremely worried\u201d about a US threat to curb steel imports for national security reasons, saying the step could trigger protectionist reactions around the world. You can read Patrick\u2019s full story here. The Berlin bureau chief Philip Oltermann\u2019s account of the ongoing protests and violence around the G20 summit in Hamburg this morning will be live shortly. Here is a foretaste: Masked protesters in black dress used flares to set fire to at least 20 cars and pelted rocks at the windows of banks and smaller stores as they made their way through the Altona district and along the Elbchausse road along the river at around 7.30am on Friday. Many stores and cafes in the area, including a local Ikea, on Friday morning boarded up their windows in anticipation of further rioting. Other protest groups marched peacefully through Hamburg\u2019s harbour area and historic centre, where they blocked access routes for delegates and envoys travelling in and out of the Messehalle conference centre where leaders including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel gathered this morning. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania Trump, was reportedly stopped from attending an event in the G20\u2019s supporting programme by the protests. \u201cPolice have not given us security clearance to leave the guesthouse,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesperson told the German press agency DPA. The Hamburg police spokesperson Sven Jahn said a group of around 60 masked protesters attacked three police vehicles with molotov cocktails, and that a flare fired at a police helicopter only narrowly missed its target. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent, Shaun Walker, has been unpacking the pictures of Trump and Putin\u2019s meeting in Hamburg: The pictures show smiles and chummy tactile contact from Trump, in what could not be a starker contrast to the strained body language of the later meetings between Putin and Barack Obama. The bilateral conversation this afternoon is likely to be \u201cone of the most scrutinised political sit-downs in years\u201d, Shaun adds, but we don\u2019t know yet whether the pair will make statements or answer questions after their talks. Realistically, Russian officials know that in the current US climate, any great breakthroughs are unlikely. But many will see merely holding the meeting, if it goes ahead in an atmosphere of bonhomie, as a win for the Kremlin. Putin has long complained the western media is unfair on Russia, and after Trump raised his complaints about \u201cfake news\u201d in Poland, he may bring it up again in the meeting with Putin. The hawkish former foreign policy official Alexei Pushkov wrote on Twitter ahead of the meeting that Putin and Trump are \u201cbrought together by the fact they both became the objects of demonisation\u201d in the press. The Russian Embassy in London is optimistic, tweeting out a poll it ran in which 62% of respondents said they think there will be \u201cprogress\u201d made in the meeting between Trump and Putin. Guardian political editor Anushka Astana writes: May has made clear that she will be seeking a trade deal with Japan after Brexit, and is likely to raise the issue in a bilateral meeting with prime minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday. \u201cWe have been promoting the concept of an EU-Japan free trade agreement \u2013 we believe that is an important agreement for the European union to sign,\u201d said May about the agreement signed just days ago. \u201cAnd as believers in free trade we have been promoting that but we are also talking to the Japanese about what arrangements we can have in place once we\u2019ve left the European Union. These are not mutually exclusive \u2013 it is possible for the European Union to have a free trade agreement with Japan and for the United Kingdom to have an agreement with Japan when we leave the EU.\u201d World leaders are meeting in Hamburg for a potentially difficult G20 summit to address serious disagreements on a number of major issues including climate change, free trade, migration and how to tackle North Korea. The meeting features a number of potentially awkward individual encounters, including the first face-to-face meeting between US president Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Trump\u2019s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and German Angela Merkel\u2019s encounter with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The north German port city has also been the scene of sometimes violent protests by crowds of anti-globalisation demonstrators, some clad in black and wearing face masks. A large number of cars have been set alight and windows smashed. Here is a midday summary: Key issues and encounters as potentially one of the most volatile G20 summits in years opens in Hamburg. What to expect from the Trump-Putin meeting, expected at 3.45pm CET. EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker warn Trump against protectionism, promising to retaliate if US president imposes punitive tariffs on steel imports. Britain\u2019s priorities will be bolstering cooperation on counter-terrorism and persuading Trump to re-engage with the Paris climate accords, Theresa May says. German police say 111 officers injured, most of them not seriously, and 44 people arrested after Thursday nights riots. Brics nations \u2013 China, India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 call for a more open global economy. Putin calls for greater cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Hamburg police ask for reinforcements amid reports of widespread rioting and car-burning. Here are the photographs of the first confirmed meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, taken from the German government\u2019s Facebook page. It is not clear whether the two men may have met before Trump was elected president; he has previously claimed to have met the Russian leader but subsequently denied it. German media are reporting that US first lady Melania Trump has been unable to leave her Hamburg residence to take part in the summit\u2019s programme for leaders\u2019 partners because of the presence of demonstrators. \u201cWe have no security clearance from the police to leave the guest house,\u201d a spokeswoman told German news agency DPA. Other partners, including Brigitte Macron, the wife of France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May\u2019s husband Philip and Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, the wife of Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau, are on a sightseeing tour with German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s husband, Joachim Sauer. Guardian political editor Anushka Asthana, who is travelling with Theresa May, writes: Theresa May is holding bilateral meetings with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, alongside meetings with the leaders of China, India and the US, Downing street have told us. They stressed that the meetings were with a string of major non-EU leaders, with May likely to want to discuss future trading possibilities. She is planning to raise North Korea, and steel dumping with President Xi this evening, ahead of the gala dinner for the world leaders and their spouses. \u201cThe prime minister would like to see China exercising more influence over north Korea and increased action to reduce overcapacity (in steel),\u201d a senior No 10 official said, adding that further economic cooperation and the question of Hong Kong would also come up. They said that the meeting with the Turkish leader tomorrow would focus on counterterrorism and the Cyprus talks. And here is what appears to be footage shot from a car of the Elbchaussee and surrounding streets in Hamburg after the earlier passage of a group of masked and black-clad protesters (see 9.55am): The user says he has seen many things in Hamburg \u2013 but not this: A Twitter user in Hamburg has posted alarming footage of cars burning in what she says is the upmarket district of Altona: And of smoke billowing from shopfronts, apparently after protesters have passed: The Guardian has not been able to verify this footage. This afternoon\u2019s keenly-awaited meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is certainly the two men\u2019s first encounter as leaders of their respective countries \u2013 but is it their first meeting ever? As the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor Julian Borger writes, over the past few years Trump has \u201cvariously claimed to have either met Putin and \u2018got along great\u2019, or to have never met him\u201d at all. Trump has always been polite about Putin and his admiration for the Russian president is in no doubt. Putin has been more cautious, calling Trump \u201ccolourful\u201d \u2013 a double-edged compliment in Russian. Here are some of Trump\u2019s statements about Putin: \u201cI do have a relationship with him\u201d November 2013 \u201cWhen I went to Russia with the Miss Universe pageant, [Putin] contacted me and was so nice\u201d February 2014 \u201cI will tell you that I think in terms of leadership [Putin] is getting an A, and our president is not doing so well\u201d September 2015 \u201cYes [we met], a long time ago. We got along great, by the way\u201d October 2015 \u201cI never met Putin. I don\u2019t know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I\u2019m a genius ... I never met Putin\u201d July 2016 And a couple of Putin\u2019s about Trump: \u201cHe is a very colourful and talented man, no doubt about that \u2026 he is the absolute leader of the presidential race, as we see it today. He says he wants to move to another level of relations, to a deeper level of relations with Russia. How can we not welcome that? Of course we welcome it\u201d December 2015 \u201cI only said that he was a bright person. Isn\u2019t he bright? He is. I did not say anything else about him\u201d June 2016 Theresa May has told the BBC the G20 leaders will try to persuade Donald Trump to rejoin the 2015 Paris climate change accord. \u201cI believe it is possible. We\u2019re not renegotiating the Paris agreement \u2013 that stays,\u201d May said. \u201cBut I want to see the United States looking for ways to rejoin it. I believe the collective message that will be given to President Trump around this table will be the importance of America coming back into that agreement, and I hope we will be able to work to ensure that can happen.\u201d The two leaders are due to meet for a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit later on Friday. Hamburg police have said a signal flare was fired at one of their helicopters this morning, which only narrowly missed. The German news agency, DPA, has confirmed that the port city\u2019s police have asked for reinforcements from elsewhere in the country, with \u201cmany crimes\u201d being committed at multiplying protests. The summit itself, meanwhile, has begun without incident. The Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, Philip Oltermann, has been speaking to more residents who witnessed last night\u2019s violence: Waltraut Waidelich, a resident of the Schanzenviertel district, said she had deliberately parked her car in the more upmarket Altona district yesterday, only find her vehicle surrounded by burnt-out cars this morning. The 60-year-old said she felt some of the violent protests where undermining more constructive protests and alternative conferences taking place in Hamburg this weekend: \u201cAt the alternative summit, I saw a lot of highly competent people looking constructively at ways in which we can transform the economy along more social and ecological lines.\u201d Some degree of protest and disagreement was normal, she said: \u201cWe have to remind politicians visiting our city that they have to work harder. But I prefer creative forms of protests, and I am not sure what torching normal people\u2019s cars is meant to achieve. There were a lot of young men on the streets who were mainly out to play cops and robbers with the police. Violence is not my way.\u201d Amid reports of widespread rioting and car-burning in the Hamburg district of Altona and elsewhere in the city, Der Spiegel reports that Hamburg police have asked for reinforcements from elsewhere in the country. \u201cWe have asked nationwide whether forces are free, and that is being examined,\u201d a police source told the magazine, confirming that a total of around 15,000 policemen are already on duty around the G20 summit . Der Spiegel cited an internal police message calling on \u201call available forces\u201d to deal with a situation that risked becoming a \u201cdanger to life and limb\u201d. Vladimir Putin has said Russia will press other G20 nations to pool their efforts more closely in the fight against terrorism. Speaking after a meeting of the so-called BRICS nations, the Russian president said Moscow would issue a call to \u201cjointly neutralise political, economic, social and ideological conditions allowing the expansion of terrorism.\u201d He added: \u201cNo nation can deal with this evil on its own and offer a reliable protection to its citizens.\u201d Putin is expected to raise the need for closer anti-terror cooperation at his meeting with US leader Donald Trump later. Donald Trump has been tweeting again. Besides his ongoing war with the media, it\u2019s not immediately clear what specifically prompted this intervention: The US president has a busy day of potentially awkward meetings ahead, including a keenly-awaited first encounter with the Russian president: The two leaders shook hands for the first on Friday morning as they arrived for the summit, the Kremlin has said. \u201cThey shook hands and said they will meet separately and see each other soon,\u201d said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Leaders of the so-called Brics nations \u2013 China, India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 have met on the sidelines of the G20-summit and calling for a more open global economy, Associated Press reports. The countries\u2019 leaders stressed the need to increase \u201cthe voice and representation\u201d of emerging markets and developing countries in global economic and financial institutions, and called for a \u201crules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system.\u201d Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke out against global trade restrictions, saying financial sanctions under political pretexts hurt mutual confidence and damaged the global economy \u2013 an apparent reference to western sanctions against Russia. The Brics leaders also urged the international community to work together to implement the Paris climate agreement, from which Donald Trump announced last month the US was withdrawing. Merkel is greeting her guests in Hamburg \u2026 Hamburg police have said said in a statement 111 police officers have been injured in the protests so far and 44 people arrested. There is no clear picture of how many demonstrators have been injured. Police have also reminded bystanders to keep the city\u2019s thoroughfares free where possible and not put themselves in unnecessary danger: Guardian political editor Anushka Asthana is travelling to the summit with prime minister Theresa May. She sends this: On counterterrorism, the prime minister spoke on the plane over about how her priority would be stemming access to funding for terror groups. Asked about pressure from opposition leaders to question Saudi Arabia about its role in financing, she said: \u201cI sit down with Saudi Arabia and others and talk about terrorist financing. But what I\u2019m doing here at the G20 is raising the need for us to work collectively internationally to deal with terrorist financing.\u201d That sounds like the prime minister is not likely to be raising any direct questions with the Saudi representative \u2013 and despite heavy pressure, the government still has not published the home office report into this issue. Pushed on climate change, after the UK did not sign up to a letter with the leaders of France, Germany and Italy expressing their disappointment at Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, May said she was disappointed. \u201cI hope they will be able to find a way to come back into the Paris agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it is possible. We are not renegotiating the Paris agreement. That stays,\u201d she added - firming up her language on this point. On domestic matters, she said the election had not ended up as she hoped but: \u201cThere\u2019s two ways the government can react to that. We can be very timid and sit back or we can be bold and that\u2019s what we are going to be.\u201d And on intimidation of candidates raised by a number of Tory MPs, including Sarah Wollaston in an interview with the Guardian, she said: \u201cThere can be no place in our democracy for behaviour like that. I\u2019m determined to do something about it. I\u2019m determined to stamp it out.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin was following the press conference earlier by EU council and commission presidents Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker and adds this: After Italy called on the rest of Europe for help in managing the large numbers of people arriving in boats from north Africa, Tusk said migration was one of the EU\u2019s top priorities for the summit. \u201cInnocent lives are being lost,\u201d said Tusk. \u201cSo far this year, more than 2000 people have died at sea and the number of people dying in the desert is even higher. We need more efforts at the international level to break the smugglers\u2019 business model.\u201d He added that he would propose to all G20 leaders pursuing \u201ctargeted UN sanctions against smugglers. By this I mean asset freezes and travel bans, it is the very minimum that can be done at global level. If we do not get it, it will be a sad proof of the hypocrisy of G20 leaders, but I still hope we will succeed.\u201d Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, also gave his first reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Warsaw, where the US president said for the first time he stood by the Nato common defence pact. The EU leader said he had heard some \u201csurprisingly promising words from the American president\u201d on transatlantic co-operation and readiness to protect the west. \u201cWe have been waiting for a long time to hear these words from President Trump, but the real question is whether it was a one-time incident or a long term policy.\u201d A video has been posted to YouTube showing black-clad demonstrators, some masked and carrying flares, marauding down a Hamburg street said to be the Elbchaussee. The film, apparently shot from an upper floor window, shows some of the demonstrators setting cars alight and smashing windows: Philip Oltermann has been out and about surveying the remains of last night\u2019s violent anti-globalisation and anti-capitalism protests in Hamburg: Some of the more aggressive protesters moved into the wealthier districts of Hamburg after the march ended around midnight. Windows of banks on a shopping street in the Othmarschen district were either smashed up or sprayed with \u201cNo G20\u201d slogans this morning. On the Elbchaussee, a picturesque road along the river dotted with villas, there were at least nine burnt-out cars and charred remains of melted plastic on the tarmac. Ariane Striemeier-Gellsen, the owner of a burnt-out Saab, said she had just got her children to get ready for school when around 30 masked protesters starting throwing bottles and Molotov cocktails on the street outside, at shortly before 8 am. \u201cThe car\u2019s insured, but it has a nostalgic value\u201d, she said. \u201cIf it had survived another year it would have been vintage\u201d. She said it had taken fire services 45 minutes to arrive on the scene. Reports that Donald Trump has had trouble finding a hotel room in Hamburg because his team waited too long to book seem to be without foundation. In a report picked up by several international media, the local Hamburger Abendblatt said the US government wanted to book Trump into the Four Seasons hotel but it \u2013 and every other luxury hotel in Hamburg \u2013 was full. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Connolly says: Speculation about this \u201chas been rife for months, with varying rumours as to why he hadn\u2019t apparently found hotel accommodation in Hamburg - everything from security concerns to the hotel chains turning him down. There was even speculation he\u2019d stay at the Adlon in Berlin, where Xi Jingping has been put up this week, because it was easier to safeguard him there, but that also appeared to be a flimsy rumour. Philip Oltermann says the reports are simply wrong: \u201cThe senate here offered him their residence, so he hasn\u2019t been looking recently.\u201d The presidents of the European council and commission, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, have used a joint press conference at the summit to warn that Europe will retaliate if US president Donald Trump starts a possible trade war by imposing punitive tariffs on steel imports, as he is reportedly considering: A day after the EU concluded a major free trade agreement with Japan, Juncker added that protectionsm was \u201cnot the way forward\u201d, his spokeswoman tweeted: Dozens of protesters have attempted to block cars from accessing the summit venue, Hamburg\u2019s trade fair and congress centre, the Associated Press reports, but were quickly cleared by police. Demonstrators blocked several intersections and so-called transfer corridors - roads designated to help delegations move between meetings. Further away in the city\u2019s Altona district, police said an operation was underway against \u201cviolent individuals\u201d who threw petrol bombs and set fire to patrol cars near a police station, Agence France-Presse reports. AP also reports police have used water cannon to clear a blockade by protesters on the banks of the Outer Alster lake, some distance from congress centre, after they repeatedly told a group of protesters to clear the road. The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor takes a closer look at what can be expected form the first face-to-face meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, scheduled for 3.45pm CET: The possibility that a 30 minute meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, interrupted by breaks for translation, is going to solve the Syrian, North Korean and Ukraine crises are at the lower end of zero. Even if the meeting over-ran until the weekend after next that would still be a challenge. Both leaders relish surprise, so it is possible one or other will spring an unexpected offer, but otherwise they are going to pick the subjects to discuss, and try to find areas of common ground on which their officials can then progress. Putin most wants to know Trump\u2019s Syria strategy. Unfortunately, so do most of the Republican party. Trump\u2019s efforts to devise a strategy have emerged looking very similar to Barack Obama\u2019s and been sent back for a rework. The two leaders are united on driving out Islamic State, but the US appears determined to leave the areas liberated by the Kurdish-led Syrian Defence Forces under the control of the SDF, rather than hand them over to Bashar al-Assad and his allies. Putin will want to know if Trump still believes in a unified Syrian state, and how much he objects to Assad remaining in office. Putin would also like US agreement to a no fly zone in southern Syria and clearer warnings if the US intends to strike Assad\u2019s air force. Trump is so unpredictable on Syria, it is likely the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, will also be taking notes. On Ukraine, the Kiev government has been reassured that Trump is not going to backslide on sanctions, but the crisis has frozen and few have any ideas how to revive the Minsk peace process. Trump will also want an explanation on why Russia does not believe North Korea used an ICBM this week \u2013 the unanimous view of the US scientific community. US Democrats will want to know if he raised Russian interference in the 2016 elections. Trump is reluctant to do so, and Putin is a specialist in the implausible denial. Trump\u2019s dilemma is simple: the more he protests Russian interference, the more he delegitimises his own mandate. Donald Trump is up and about, if his Twitter account is anything to go by. The US president had this to say about his visit to Warsaw yesterday, where before heading to Hamburg he delivered a highly nationalist speech saying the survival of the west was at risk from hostile forces ranging from Islamic terrorism to Russia, statism and secularism: Once in Germany, he met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Thursday evening: No designated protest marches are planned for today, but lots of actions and stunts are scheduled around Hamburg, Philip Oltermann reports, and there are reports of some demonstrators being kettled and police using water cannon already this morning. Merkel was born in Hamburg and reportedly chose the city as the venue for this summit to send a message of openness. But the Hamburg police chief, Ralf Martin Meyer, has expressed concerns the city would see \u201cnot just sit-in protests but massive assaults\u201d as anarchists from Scandinavia, Switzerland and Italy join up with local activists in a city with a long tradition of left-wing protest and riots. The Hamburg congress centre, where the summit is being held, is only a short distance from one of Germany\u2019s most potent symbols of left-wing, anti-capitalist resistance: a former theatre called the \u201cRote Flora\u201d. As leaders were arriving on Thursday, riot police were firing water cannon and pepper spray at a group of about a thousand masked and black-clad protesters who hurled bottles on the fringes of a \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d demonstration. More than 100,000 demonstrators are expected to join a series of major protest marches on Saturday. Climate change was meant to have been one of the top priorities of this G20 , but the election of Donald Trump and his subsequent decision to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris accord changed all that. No one now expects any consensus to emerge on the issue; Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has already said it was \u201cobvious\u201d there was no agreement on the question and it would be \u201cdishonest to gloss it over\u201d. Indeed, writes Philip Oltermann in Hamburg, Trump and Vladimir Putin could spend as little as 15 minutes discussing climate change with the other G20 leaders if the two leaders\u2019 schedules for Friday\u2019s first day of the summit are to be believed. The White House\u2019s schedule states that Trump will meet Putin for their first bilateral at 3.45 CET \u2013 a quarter of an hour after the start of a G20 working session on climate change and energy issues. Russian news agency Interfax reported that Putin and Trump would meet at 4pm. The German news magazine Der Spiegel said the two leaders could be forced to skip the working session on climate change altogether. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the G20 summit in Hamburg, where the leaders of the world\u2019s major economies are meeting for what looks set to be one of the most fractious gatherings in years. The first face-to-face meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at 3.45pm CET has grabbed the headlines. But with multiple major disagreements to address in a period of real global uncertainty there are many reasons why the two-day summit in the northern German port city could prove volatile both inside and \u2013 with police and protestors already clashing \u2013 outside the venue. Issues and leaders to watch include: North Korea\u2019s first successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. US president Donald Trump will seek to persuade his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to exert more pressure. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wanted global migration and climate change to top the summit agenda and has vowed to strongly defend the 2015 Paris climate accord with EU allies after Trump pulled the US out last month. Trump also faces clashes, particularly with Germany and China, over his protectionist \u201cbuy American, hire American\u201d agenda. He is reportedly weighing punitive 20% tariffs on steel imports. Trump\u2019s encounter with Putin will be closely watched: the pair disagree on foreign policy from Syria to Ukraine and North Korea, Trump on Thursday accused Russia of acting as a destabilising force, and US intelligence officials\u2019 have repeatedly said Putin directed a major hacking operation to tip the presidential election Trump\u2019s way. Trump\u2019s talks with Xi will also be critical; the two are at odds over policy towards North Korea, trade, arms sales and territorial waters. Merkel\u2019s meeting with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also likely to be a frosty affair, with relations between Berlin and Ankara badly strained by rights abuses in the wake of Turkey\u2019s failed coup last year. And the summit takes place against a backdrop of mass street protests by radical, hard left and anti-globalisation activists, including up to 8,000 potentially violent extremists. Some 20,000 police are on duty and rallies have been banned in a large area of the city, which has a long history of violent protest. Police used water canon and pepper spray on Thursday night as up to 12,000 demonstrators, some wearing masks, set off on a \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d march. Cars were set alight, bottles and smoke bombs thrown, and police said 74 officers were wounded, most with minor injuries.",

          "body": "<h2>\u2018Something\u2019s not working at the moment\u2019</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/feb/03/bridget-christie-funny-side-of-brexit\">Bridget Christie</a>, comedian</strong></p> <p>Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are threatening to nuke each other. The UK has had four terror attacks in four months. David Cameron called the EU referendum, lost, resigned, said: \u201cDum de dum de dum\u201d, then retreated to his \u00a325,000 sheepskin-insulated manshed at the bottom of his garden to eat artisanal cheese. The man who sold me my bicycle refused to put the basket on it because he thought it was a girl\u2019s job. </p> <p>We don\u2019t know what the world would look like if women ruled it, but something\u2019s not working at the moment. While we can\u2019t say for certain that women would make a better fist of it, or behave any better, what we do know is that when women are in leadership positions, or involved in decision-making, societies work better. There is less violence and instability and more peace. </p> <p>If women were in charge, I doubt that eight men would have the same wealth as the poorest 50% of the world\u2019s population. Eight! I\u2019ve had more people on my trampoline at once. When a group of men whose combined wealth equals that of 3.6 billion people can comfortably frolic together on one trampoline, it\u2019s time for a leadership change.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Women would never be the victim\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/12/marina-abramovic-ready-to-die-serpentine-gallery-512-hours\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, artist</strong></p> <p>If women ruled the world, they would stop being fragile, they would stop being dependent, they would never be the victim, they would never be abused. I want women to be warriors. When women are free and happy, they will know how to rule the world.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Reproductive sexual difference remains the villain of the piece\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-holmes\">Rachel Holmes</a>, biographer of Sylvia Pankhurst</strong></p> <p>Supremacy based on gender has never been an attractive idea and patriarchal dystopias are no longer in an imagined future, or long buried past, but part of our present. Patriarchy makes us equal in one way, though: men are as arrested in their development as women. Given the challenges of being in charge, you\u2019d think they would be more than happy to hand over the headache and see what difference having women in charge makes.</p> <p>Tory women prime ministers make no difference, because a system that is fundamentally based on the principle of unequal power relationships cannot, by definition, make us equal. Promoting the F-word without challenging the C-word has never worked: it is not possible to achieve the aims of feminism within the capitalist system. Our feminist foremothers warned us of this. Where we\u2019ve got to so far is largely based on a limited agenda of establishing so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d within stunted liberal democracies.</p> <p>People take hope \u2013 and even experience some freedom \u2013 in successfully challenging the pantomime binaries of masculinity and femininity. But reproductive sexual difference remains the villain of the piece. If women are to rule the world and make a difference, we either need to overhaul the social and economic system of reproductive exploitation (on which the system was built), or take control of the re-engineering of human design that is already under way.</p> <p>We should design a reparations scheme that reorganises parental and family responsibilities in such a way that men have the opportunity to pay women back for the last two millennia \u2013 the incentive being the universally agreed cultural value that raising families brings joy. The first job of the woman in charge is to liberate the men.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Men kill more people than women\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/18/shazia-mirza-look-at-me-isis-would-stone-me-to-death\">Shazia Mirza</a>, comedian</strong></p> <p>There\u2019d be less violence, we\u2019d get things done quicker and we would solve a lot of problems by chatting \u2013 instead of bombing. We would think rationally. People think: \u201cOh, women can\u2019t make decisions when it\u2019s the time of the month\u201d and all that, but I think we\u2019re very decisive. We don\u2019t waste any time and we would do things a lot cleaner and a lot quicker. There would be fewer people dying if women were in charge. It\u2019s a fact: men kill more people than women.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Historically, women in power out-men the men\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/22/louise-doughty-thrillers-apple-tree-yard-black-water\">Louise Doughty</a>, novelist</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m not a fan of biological determinism, even when it\u2019s working in women\u2019s favour \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure I subscribe to the idea that women are innately caring and collegiate and men thrusting and ambitious. I\u2019ve lost track of the number of times I\u2019ve watched mothers coo over their daughters cuddling baby dolls, praise them for it, then declare that caring skills are instinctive for girls.</p> <p>Historically, what we\u2019ve seen is that when women achieve power in a man\u2019s world, they often out-men the men. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\">Margaret Thatcher</a> was famous for rarely promoting other women. She got off on being the only woman in the room and didn\u2019t want any competition. Nothing is more depressing than a successful woman who wants to score points for being the only one among the boys \u2013 reinforcing, rather than challenging, their views of other women. </p> <p>So if you really wanted to see whether there is a difference in the way women would rule the world, you would have to have either all-female rulers or a critical mass. But, ultimately, I\u2019m resistant to the idea of lumping us all together on the basis of gender: what about race, class, sexual orientation? Even men I like are fond of saying \u201cwomen this\u201d or \u201cwomen that\u201d as if we are all one amorphous mass. I\u2019m instinctively resistant to binaries. Hooray for ambiguity, nuance and complexity.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Women are taking their rightful place as equals\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/caroline-lucas\">Caroline Lucas MP</a>, co-leader of Green party</strong></p> <p>Having women in power makes a real difference. As the number of woman MPs has increased in the Commons, we\u2019ve seen major steps forward in tackling gender discrimination. Women leaders in business make a difference too: helping firms embrace modern ideas like flexible working and job sharing. </p> <p>Green politics has a history of woman leaders, from the inspirational Petra Kelly in Germany, to Vandata Shiva. I\u2019m proud to be part of a movement that\u2019s had women at the top table. Of course, having female leaders isn\u2019t an end in itself. It\u2019s part of a broad movement that sees women taking their rightful place as equals at every level in society.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Unseen female executives mobilise other women\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/feb/05/sarah-sands-new-boss-bbc-radio-4-today-evening-standard\">Sarah Sands</a>, editor of Today programme Radio 4</strong></p> <p>It is often the unseen women, the executives, who have an opportunity to mobilise and encourage other women. Four inspirations from my own career: Clare Hollingworth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/10/clare-hollingworth-obituary\">the woman who got the scoop of the century</a> about the outbreak of the second world war. I met her when I was deputy editor of the Daily Telegraph, and she assumed I was the editor\u2019s secretary, which amused me. She was a woman of her time, a pioneer rather than a reformer. Marie Colvin, the Sunday Times reporter, was sisterly as well as brave. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jul/08/guardianobituaries2\">Genevieve Cooper</a> was deputy editor of the Evening Standard when I joined. I was a 24-year-old single mother and my male boss asked me how I could guarantee that a baby would not interfere with my work. I was so fearful that, when my small son was in hospital, I commuted between his ward and work, inventing excuses to leave the office rather than admit that I had a seriously ill child. Genevieve rescued me. At the Guardian, the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/07/georgina-henry\">Georgina Henry</a> showed that you could have vision and authority without losing your humanity. She was a top-notch female boss.</p> <h2>\u2018Oppression will not cease to exist simply because a woman is in charge\u2019</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/june-eric-udorie\">June Eric-Udorie</a>, editor of intersectional feminism anthology to be published by Virago UK and Penguin US in 2018</strong><br></p> <p>If you run in feminist circles, you\u2019re bound to have heard someone declare: \u201cWouldn\u2019t the world just be better if more women were in charge?\u201d What runs through my mind when I hear this is: \u201cWhich women?\u201d Are we talking about black women, disabled women, trans women? Are we thinking about the women who lie on the margins and the intersections of the feminist movement, or do we just expect them to continue to have little to no power? <br></p> <p>The inevitable reality is that the women most likely to have power in a female-run world will be white, middle class, cis, able-bodied and heterosexual. Power structures and other forms of oppression will not cease to exist simply because a woman is in charge. History will remind us of the ways in which white women have exploited and benefited from the oppression of their non-white female counterparts. Taking a closer look at so called \u201cfeminist victories\u201d \u2013 such as the birth of the contraceptive pill or the suffrage movement \u2013 will reveal pandemic racism, classism, and other forms of subjugation and oppression. <br></p> <p>We need to do away with romanticising matriarchal power and dominance \u2013 and instead question the ways we can change the problematic and dangerous power structures that operate within society today.<br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018In the peace movement, women are not interested in power over others\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katehudson\">Kate Hudson</a>, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</strong></p> <p>The peace movement is the place to find powerful women. But they\u2019re not interested in power over others. Instead, they are empowering, inspiring by example, breaking down barriers to thinking, and taking action.

Family-friendly policies will be formulated to enable both parents to enjoy the privileges of parenting. Unfair stereotypes and standards imposed upon men to ensure they fit into an iron scaffold of masculinity will be lifted. </p> <p>I hope to see a world with greater peace and diplomacy, collaboration and cooperation. Women are less likely engage in wars or violence \u2013 as the protection of families and communities is central to their decision-making. They propel their countries \u2013 and the world \u2013 towards socioeconomic success.

          "bodyText": "\u2018Something\u2019s not working at the moment\u2019 Bridget Christie, comedian Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump are threatening to nuke each other. The UK has had four terror attacks in four months. David Cameron called the EU referendum, lost, resigned, said: \u201cDum de dum de dum\u201d, then retreated to his \u00a325,000 sheepskin-insulated manshed at the bottom of his garden to eat artisanal cheese. The man who sold me my bicycle refused to put the basket on it because he thought it was a girl\u2019s job. We don\u2019t know what the world would look like if women ruled it, but something\u2019s not working at the moment. While we can\u2019t say for certain that women would make a better fist of it, or behave any better, what we do know is that when women are in leadership positions, or involved in decision-making, societies work better. There is less violence and instability and more peace. If women were in charge, I doubt that eight men would have the same wealth as the poorest 50% of the world\u2019s population. Eight! I\u2019ve had more people on my trampoline at once. When a group of men whose combined wealth equals that of 3.6 billion people can comfortably frolic together on one trampoline, it\u2019s time for a leadership change. \u2018Women would never be the victim\u2019 Marina Abramovi\u0107, artist If women ruled the world, they would stop being fragile, they would stop being dependent, they would never be the victim, they would never be abused. I want women to be warriors. When women are free and happy, they will know how to rule the world. \u2018Reproductive sexual difference remains the villain of the piece\u2019 Rachel Holmes, biographer of Sylvia Pankhurst Supremacy based on gender has never been an attractive idea and patriarchal dystopias are no longer in an imagined future, or long buried past, but part of our present. Patriarchy makes us equal in one way, though: men are as arrested in their development as women. Given the challenges of being in charge, you\u2019d think they would be more than happy to hand over the headache and see what difference having women in charge makes. Tory women prime ministers make no difference, because a system that is fundamentally based on the principle of unequal power relationships cannot, by definition, make us equal. Promoting the F-word without challenging the C-word has never worked: it is not possible to achieve the aims of feminism within the capitalist system. Our feminist foremothers warned us of this. Where we\u2019ve got to so far is largely based on a limited agenda of establishing so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d within stunted liberal democracies. People take hope \u2013 and even experience some freedom \u2013 in successfully challenging the pantomime binaries of masculinity and femininity. But reproductive sexual difference remains the villain of the piece. If women are to rule the world and make a difference, we either need to overhaul the social and economic system of reproductive exploitation (on which the system was built), or take control of the re-engineering of human design that is already under way. We should design a reparations scheme that reorganises parental and family responsibilities in such a way that men have the opportunity to pay women back for the last two millennia \u2013 the incentive being the universally agreed cultural value that raising families brings joy. The first job of the woman in charge is to liberate the men. \u2018Men kill more people than women\u2019 Shazia Mirza, comedian There\u2019d be less violence, we\u2019d get things done quicker and we would solve a lot of problems by chatting \u2013 instead of bombing. We would think rationally. People think: \u201cOh, women can\u2019t make decisions when it\u2019s the time of the month\u201d and all that, but I think we\u2019re very decisive. We don\u2019t waste any time and we would do things a lot cleaner and a lot quicker. There would be fewer people dying if women were in charge. It\u2019s a fact: men kill more people than women. \u2018Historically, women in power out-men the men\u2019 Louise Doughty, novelist I\u2019m not a fan of biological determinism, even when it\u2019s working in women\u2019s favour \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure I subscribe to the idea that women are innately caring and collegiate and men thrusting and ambitious. I\u2019ve lost track of the number of times I\u2019ve watched mothers coo over their daughters cuddling baby dolls, praise them for it, then declare that caring skills are instinctive for girls. Historically, what we\u2019ve seen is that when women achieve power in a man\u2019s world, they often out-men the men. Margaret Thatcher was famous for rarely promoting other women. She got off on being the only woman in the room and didn\u2019t want any competition. Nothing is more depressing than a successful woman who wants to score points for being the only one among the boys \u2013 reinforcing, rather than challenging, their views of other women. So if you really wanted to see whether there is a difference in the way women would rule the world, you would have to have either all-female rulers or a critical mass. But, ultimately, I\u2019m resistant to the idea of lumping us all together on the basis of gender: what about race, class, sexual orientation? Even men I like are fond of saying \u201cwomen this\u201d or \u201cwomen that\u201d as if we are all one amorphous mass. I\u2019m instinctively resistant to binaries. Hooray for ambiguity, nuance and complexity. \u2018Women are taking their rightful place as equals\u2019 Caroline Lucas MP, co-leader of Green party Having women in power makes a real difference. As the number of woman MPs has increased in the Commons, we\u2019ve seen major steps forward in tackling gender discrimination. Women leaders in business make a difference too: helping firms embrace modern ideas like flexible working and job sharing. Green politics has a history of woman leaders, from the inspirational Petra Kelly in Germany, to Vandata Shiva. I\u2019m proud to be part of a movement that\u2019s had women at the top table. Of course, having female leaders isn\u2019t an end in itself. It\u2019s part of a broad movement that sees women taking their rightful place as equals at every level in society. \u2018Unseen female executives mobilise other women\u2019 Sarah Sands, editor of Today programme Radio 4 It is often the unseen women, the executives, who have an opportunity to mobilise and encourage other women. Four inspirations from my own career: Clare Hollingworth, the woman who got the scoop of the century about the outbreak of the second world war. I met her when I was deputy editor of the Daily Telegraph, and she assumed I was the editor\u2019s secretary, which amused me. She was a woman of her time, a pioneer rather than a reformer. Marie Colvin, the Sunday Times reporter, was sisterly as well as brave. Genevieve Cooper was deputy editor of the Evening Standard when I joined. I was a 24-year-old single mother and my male boss asked me how I could guarantee that a baby would not interfere with my work. I was so fearful that, when my small son was in hospital, I commuted between his ward and work, inventing excuses to leave the office rather than admit that I had a seriously ill child. Genevieve rescued me. At the Guardian, the late Georgina Henry showed that you could have vision and authority without losing your humanity. She was a top-notch female boss. \u2018Oppression will not cease to exist simply because a woman is in charge\u2019 June Eric-Udorie, editor of intersectional feminism anthology to be published by Virago UK and Penguin US in 2018 If you run in feminist circles, you\u2019re bound to have heard someone declare: \u201cWouldn\u2019t the world just be better if more women were in charge?\u201d What runs through my mind when I hear this is: \u201cWhich women?\u201d Are we talking about black women, disabled women, trans women? Are we thinking about the women who lie on the margins and the intersections of the feminist movement, or do we just expect them to continue to have little to no power? The inevitable reality is that the women most likely to have power in a female-run world will be white, middle class, cis, able-bodied and heterosexual. Power structures and other forms of oppression will not cease to exist simply because a woman is in charge. History will remind us of the ways in which white women have exploited and benefited from the oppression of their non-white female counterparts. Taking a closer look at so called \u201cfeminist victories\u201d \u2013 such as the birth of the contraceptive pill or the suffrage movement \u2013 will reveal pandemic racism, classism, and other forms of subjugation and oppression. We need to do away with romanticising matriarchal power and dominance \u2013 and instead question the ways we can change the problematic and dangerous power structures that operate within society today. \u2018In the peace movement, women are not interested in power over others\u2019 Kate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament The peace movement is the place to find powerful women. But they\u2019re not interested in power over others. Instead, they are empowering, inspiring by example, breaking down barriers to thinking, and taking action. They\u2019re uncompromising, but in a good way. My role models are Pat Arrowsmith, organiser of the first Aldermaston March, who was imprisoned many times for anti-nuclear actions; and Helen John, one of the Greenham Women and an activist at Menwith Hill in Yorkshire. The earth shakes when such women move into action! \u2018I don\u2019t think anything would change\u2019 Marjane Satrapi, author of Persepolis I don\u2019t think anything would change if women had the power. For me, this comes from the idea that men and women are very alike and very equal. I don\u2019t think the notion of empathy or being nice depends ongender at all, because if you consider women to be so much nicer, in a way that\u2019s to say they\u2019re like nice little animals that can\u2019t get angry, and that anger is something for men. I don\u2019t think women write differently from men, or make movies differently. When it comes to physical effort, there is a difference. But when it comes to intellect, people with the same experiences and same sensitivities end up being the same kind of people, regardless of gender. \u2018I am impressed by young women\u2019s energy and competence\u2019 Penelope Lively, Booker-winning novelist At 84, I want to celebrate a new generation of women. I have three granddaughters in their 20s, so I meet up with \u2013 and hear about \u2013 plenty of young women in that age group. I am constantly impressed by, and rejoice in, their energy and competence. They work their socks off, and assume working life will reward them, but they are flexible and adaptable. Their assumptions about the role of women, about what women can expect, are very different from those of my generation, from back in the 1950s. We would have been startled to look ahead and see Theresa May and Angela Merkel. The outlook and the performance of today\u2019s twentysomething women is heartwarming. \u2018I can think of some vicious, cruel women who have been in power\u2019 Jane Goodall, primatologist I thought about this and the answer is I don\u2019t know. It depends which female qualities we\u2019re talking about, because sometimes one finds that the women who become successful are the ones who develop male-type characteristics. If you could pick women with more compassionate characteristics, then there are men with those characteristics too. I know it\u2019s tempting to say that it would be better if more women were doing this and more women were doing that. But I believe power corrupts absolutely. We can think of some extraordinarily vicious, brutal and cruel women who have been in great powerful positions. To me, it just wouldn\u2019t make much difference.\u201d \u2018All my life experience tells me women make a difference\u2019 Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary, Trades Union Congress Unlike the popular old song, I can\u2019t promise that, if women ruled the world, every day would be like the first day of spring.

And hopefully, with the right head-bitch in charge, there would be some kind of limit to how much a man was allowed to interrupt and mansplain. I imagine we would call it the Law of Sschhh: if a woman says sschhh to a man, he is bound by law to go home and sit down and shut up. Soon, there will be no sexual assault, no catcalling, no mansplaining, no #notallmen. We would of course have a list of Dudes Who Are All Right, who would get to suggest laws every once in awhile.

Family-friendly policies will be formulated to enable both parents to enjoy the privileges of parenting. Unfair stereotypes and standards imposed upon men to ensure they fit into an iron scaffold of masculinity will be lifted. I hope to see a world with greater peace and diplomacy, collaboration and cooperation. Women are less likely engage in wars or violence \u2013 as the protection of families and communities is central to their decision-making. They propel their countries \u2013 and the world \u2013 towards socioeconomic success. And they work to promote social justice and inclusion, climate change management and reduced hunger, poverty and inequality. \u2018There are still so many meetings where women are not even in the room\u2019 Harriet Harman MP It\u2019s not about leaders and role models. It\u2019s about sisterhood and working together. If we only had women MPs, right now Labour would be in government with a huge majority \u2013 because we\u2019ve got 119 and the Tories have only got 67. That\u2019s a good reason to have only women MPs. But what you really want is a balanced team of women and men. There are still so many meetings where women are not even in the room. Although Donald Trump feels like a threat to turn the clock back, I think there is an irresistible force for further change all around the world.

Two years ago, Justin Trudeau\u2019s appointment of the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/canada-cabinet-gender-diversity-justin-trudeau\">first gender-equal cabinet</a> made headlines worldwide. Recently, his government has released what has been called the \u201cfirst <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-unveils-new-feminism-focused-foreign-aid-policy/article35260311/\">feminist foreign aid policy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But now Canada\u2019s own record on gender equality has been called into question by a perhaps unlikely source. The McKinsey Global Institute, a research arm of the corporate consultancy giant, has declared that the country\u2019s workplaces have a \u201csubstantial gender gap\u201d.</p> <p> In a <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/women-matter/the-power-of-parity-advancing-womens-equality-in-canada\">124-page report</a>, it describes tackling enduring gender inequalities at work as \u201ca considerable economic opportunity\u201d for Canada, which it predicts could add upwards of $150bn to the country\u2019s GDP by 2026. McKinsey\u2019s Tiffany Vogel <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gender-equality-mckinsey-1.4169287\">told CBC</a> that gender equality is \u201cnot just a moral imperative [and] not just the right thing to do \u2013 it\u2019s good business practice\u201d.</p> <p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/gender-pay-gap-a-persistent-issue-in-canada/article34210790/\">data from Canada\u2019s national statistics agency</a> shows that for every $1 a man makes, on average a woman makes $0.74 \u2013 in part because women are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs, including in fast food and hotel work.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://brocku.ca/brock-news/2016/04/brock-labour-expert-releases-report-on-gender-wage-gap-in-retail/\">study of Ontario retail workers</a> \u2013 most of whom are women \u2013 found that men earn more across all job categories, and are more likely to be offered full-time jobs or employed as managers. </p> <p>The gender issue pervades all levels of business: <a href=\"https://www.mvma.ca/sites/default/files/u522/Vitality-July_GENERIC-EN.pdf\">corporate boards are dominated by men, and 95% of CEOs are male</a>. McKinsey surveyed 69 of Canada\u2019s largest companies and found that fewer women were being promoted.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s prime minister is a self-proclaimed feminist. Two years ago, Justin Trudeau\u2019s appointment of the country\u2019s first gender-equal cabinet made headlines worldwide. Recently, his government has released what has been called the \u201cfirst feminist foreign aid policy\u201d. But now Canada\u2019s own record on gender equality has been called into question by a perhaps unlikely source. The McKinsey Global Institute, a research arm of the corporate consultancy giant, has declared that the country\u2019s workplaces have a \u201csubstantial gender gap\u201d. In a 124-page report, it describes tackling enduring gender inequalities at work as \u201ca considerable economic opportunity\u201d for Canada, which it predicts could add upwards of $150bn to the country\u2019s GDP by 2026. McKinsey\u2019s Tiffany Vogel told CBC that gender equality is \u201cnot just a moral imperative [and] not just the right thing to do \u2013 it\u2019s good business practice\u201d. Recent data from Canada\u2019s national statistics agency shows that for every $1 a man makes, on average a woman makes $0.74 \u2013 in part because women are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs, including in fast food and hotel work. A study of Ontario retail workers \u2013 most of whom are women \u2013 found that men earn more across all job categories, and are more likely to be offered full-time jobs or employed as managers. The gender issue pervades all levels of business: corporate boards are dominated by men, and 95% of CEOs are male. McKinsey surveyed 69 of Canada\u2019s largest companies and found that fewer women were being promoted. Among these companies, women make up 45% of entry-level workers, 25% of vice-presidents and 15% of CEOs. \u201cThe gender pay gap persists in all types of occupations, even when women are in higher-paying jobs,\u201d said Trish Hennessy, a director at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) thinktank. Pay gaps are particularly pronounced for immigrants and indigenous women, she added. Hennessy said one way to close these gaps is to \u201crevalue the caring work that women do\u201d \u2013 referring to unpaid work at home, caring for family members, and paid work including in early childhood education. \u201cUnionisation helps, too,\u201d she said. \u201cThe gender pay gap is lower in unionised jobs \u2013 unions can be a great equaliser.\u201d Last year, Canada also fell down in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender equality rankings, to 35th place. In 1995, it was in first place. Armine Yalnizyan, a Canadian economist and business commentator, said that while gender inequality at work is a national problem, \u201cthere are huge variations across the country\u201d. For instance, she said the Saskatchewan province appears more equal than neighbouring Alberta, which has larger pay gaps.

While the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8mtyr3hzBKuwyJirWP2GjLHTbsGOdmQG\">Conservatives posted relentless YouTube attack videos</a> and bought up Snapchat advertising slots, some mostly young Labour supporters were spreading the love for Corbyn using the argot and themes relevant to them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/22/milifandom-soars-with-twitter-backing-for-labour-leader-ed-miliband\">Milifandom</a> had nothing on Corbyn\u2019s online appeal. Here are a few examples of Corbyn memes that flew in the election campaign. Could they have swept people all the way to the polls?</p> <h2>The Absolute Boy</h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-WqYEA1ql0\">video by the leftwing commentator Aaron Bastani</a> was one of the most widely shared uses of this name for Corbyn. It\u2019s unclear where it originated (Absolute Boy is an anime series, but I doubt it\u2019s that), but it shows the youth demographic adopting Corbyn as one of their own and in their own vernacular.<br></p> <p>Where did this end?

We no longer have the option to pretend that what happens in Britain or America is separate. We do not live in fiefdoms. We must all work together to quell the tide of hate and complacency. Which is why, despite my US Passport, I desperately urge my U.K. friends/fans/frenemies to get out and vote for the Labour Party. With Jeremy Corbyn you have a chance at a fair and just leader who will temper the fascism and darkness of our current American moment.

          "bodyText": "You can\u2019t get away from social media in the political debate, just as you can\u2019t get away from social media full-stop. Ever since Barack Obama\u2019s victory was branded the Facebook election, people have looked at online movements and wondered what impact they have at the polling station. But something different is happening with Jeremy Corbyn. While the Conservatives posted relentless YouTube attack videos and bought up Snapchat advertising slots, some mostly young Labour supporters were spreading the love for Corbyn using the argot and themes relevant to them. Milifandom had nothing on Corbyn\u2019s online appeal. Here are a few examples of Corbyn memes that flew in the election campaign. Could they have swept people all the way to the polls? The Absolute Boy A video by the leftwing commentator Aaron Bastani was one of the most widely shared uses of this name for Corbyn. It\u2019s unclear where it originated (Absolute Boy is an anime series, but I doubt it\u2019s that), but it shows the youth demographic adopting Corbyn as one of their own and in their own vernacular. Where did this end? With \u201cGet on board with the absolute boy\u201d badges and an Instagram post of Lena Dunham holding one. There\u2019s also a sense of benevolent laddism in this take. Whether it\u2019s accidentally high-fiving the breast of Emily Thornberry, or his brilliant response to a supporter who asked (after Theresa May\u2019s wheat field) what the naughtiest thing he had ever done was, Corbyn has been held up as a cheeky fella in response to May\u2019s stiff vicar\u2019s daughter. One of the lads, innit. Corbyn or May? This particular meme never fails to deliver. Inspired by the Bernie or Hillary? meme last summer, it pits the two leaders\u2019 outlooks against each other. May v Corbyn then spread to El Gato (Corbyn\u2019s cat) v Larry (the chief mouser at No 10). #LastMinuteCorbynSmears As you may have noticed, the rightwing press has gone after Corbyn relentlessly (though whether it still has the influence of the past is up for debate). To counter this, #LastMinuteCorbynSmears trended on Twitter, because you have to fight back. Jam and other niche interests Corbyn has never been shy about his love of jam, or marrows, or allotments. He makes his own jam and he\u2019s proud of it, even talking about it on The One Show. One of the best moments of Vice\u2019s documentary on Corbyn was him outlining a plan to sign apples for fans. It\u2019s even said he has sometimes been incommunicado because of his jam-making. Corbyn\u2019s other niche interests include manhole covers (yes, really), marrows and trains. My favourite headline of the campaign might have been: \u201cCorbyn: yes, I collect manhole covers\u201d. And what the hell is wrong with that? Pringles I like to think it all started with this man\u2019s amusing tweet about Jeremy Paxman\u2019s interview style after the BBC debate: The next day a Corbyn fan offered him a Pringle, which he promptly gulped down after holding it up to the crowd to cheers. The video of this moment has 23,000 likes and more than 8,000 shares. Interestingly, Pringles has yet to capitalise on this; usually companies on Twitter are keen to insert themselves into every narrative for maximum brand reach. Who knew that a Pelican-mouth-shaped crisp would feature so prominently? Why is this important? Because politicians never manage to eat normally (see: Miliband and bacon, May and chips), and Corbyn passed this test. Radio Times even called it the \u201cturning point of the general election\u201d. Grime hero It seems that #grime4Corbyn has had a genuine cut-through, especially with the young and non-white electorate, though turnout figures won\u2019t be known for a week or so. Our reporter Iman Amrani went to the gig in London and found widespread enthusiasm and motivation from the crowd there. The social reach for #grime4corbyn was also huge, with that particular hashtag trending higher than Corbyn\u2019s manifesto on its launch day. Implausibly, even Danny DeVito got in on it, with 27,000 retweets and counting. As the Guardian\u2019s film shows, this online buzz seems to have translated IRL (in real life). Grime fans also said the leader\u2019s interview with the grime star JME, a coup for iD magazine, encouraged them to sign up to vote for the first time. Labour\u2019s leader was also on the cover of NME and Kerrang! magazines and musicians outside of grime lending their support included Akala, Clean Bandit, Lily Allen, Kyla La Grange, MIA and Rag N Bone Man. But it really is grime that has fuelled the grassroots engagement. As photoshops of Corbyn on Dizzee Rascal\u2019s seminal Boy in da Corner album cover show. Fashion king Vogue published an entire piece on Corbyn\u2019s style and how it mirrored the hip label of the moment, Vetements. The shell suits; the pop-socks and trainers; the functional wear. A big hit has also been the (fan-made) Nike and Corbyn mash-up T-shirt, echoing the NHS one that was popular a while ago (as seen on pop star Jessie Ware). The Corbyn version was made by two friends in Bristol, and has sold out on their online shop. It has been seen widely on the streets as well as on celebrity and #influencer Instagram feeds. For some reason, May on the other hand, who is supposedly the fashion-obsessed politician, has taken to wearing the exact same outfit repeatedly. Why on earth she keeps wearing the outfit that links her in the collective conscious with that awkward Trump encounter is unknown (she wore it again on election night). Kids and animals They say never work with kids and animals, but Corbyn definitely works with both, as plenty of photo opportunities and meet and greets showed. He\u2019s similar in that sense to Obama and the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who have both benefited from their ease around babies and dogs, and the memes that lends itself to. Fighting mode Corbyn There\u2019s been a good narrative of subverting the image of Corbyn as a jam-loving, sweater-vest-wearing softie, by re-imagining him as scrapping for a fight, touching on the previous laddism. There\u2019s a Twitter account, @AngryCorbyn, which collates these memes, and most images are lifted from that time a frustrated Corbyn was pulled away from the political press corps. Smooth Corbyn Given a huge boost by the skit Corbyn did for The Last Leg in which he appeared in a tuxedo and floor-length fur coat, the smooth Corbyn meme is the opposite of the scrappy Corbyn seen above. In particular, the gif of Corbyn turning to the camera, appearing to break the fourth wall, with a confident expression was huge. (Shades too of this Miliband turning to the camera to the sound of Careless Whisper meme). Footy Corbs A lifelong Arsenal fan, who was at Wembley to watch the club\u2019s FA Cup win, Corbyn has also said he would invite European leaders to a match as a form of friendly diplomacy. The cross-section of football fans and Corbyn supporters has been huge. This may be down to his support for grassroots football and his YouTube videos promoting his policies on football.

She insisted that the family would not be drawn into hatred by the atrocity. \u201cWhile our pain will never diminish, it is important for us to carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who would try to destroy us, and remember that hatred is the refuge of small-minded individuals, and will only breed more,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a course we will follow, despite our loss.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Kirsty Boden </h2> \n<p>Boden had been working in London since 2013. In a statement, her family said: \u201cKirsty was loved and adored by her family, friends and boyfriend. She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people. Helping people was what she loved to do in her job as a nurse and in her daily life.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs she ran towards danger, in an effort to help people on the bridge, Kirsty sadly lost her life. We are so proud of Kirsty\u2019s brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life. Kirsty \u2013 we love you and we will miss you dearly.\u201d</p> \n<p>She was a keen traveller and in a blog described herself as \u201cjust your average dreamer, with a full-time job and a constant longing to go where I haven\u2019t been\u201d. Recent posts were from Milan, Sofia, Lisbon and Kiev, for the 2017 Eurovision song contest.

She said he had been meeting up with school friends and had not been home or in contact since the attack. Friends had checked hospitals without success. The Londoner was about to launch an e-learning business.</p> \n<p>Reading a statement announcing that James was believed to be among the victims after his bank card was found on one of those killed, Melissa, 30, said: \u201cFrom his friends who were with him on the night, they want everyone to know what a generous and caring friend he was. Words will never be able to match his essence. There will only ever be one James. Nowhere else will you find such humour and unique personality and someone who puts friends and family above all else. He was an inspiration.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Christine Archibald</strong></h2> \n<p>A Canadian victim was named by her family as Christine Archibald, from Castlegar, British Columbia. After graduating in social work from Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, she had worked at a homeless shelter. Her family said: \u201cWe grieve the loss of our beautiful, loving daughter and sister.

His sister, Cassie Ferguson, told CBC News: \u201cHe is broken into a million pieces.

Two are confirmed killed, while police searching for a third missing man have recovered a body from the Thames. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: \u201cIt is with great sadness that I have learned that one of the French citizens, who was previously given as unaccounted for, has been identified among those who have died.\u201d</p> \n<p>Le Drian did not name the victim but French media identified him as S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, from Angers, a chef at the Coq d\u2019Argent restaurant in the City who friends and relatives said had been watching the Champions league final with friends in a Borough market restaurant called Boro Bistro. B\u00e9langer, who had lived in London for seven years, was reported missing by his girlfriend, Gerda Bennet, a bartender in Hoxton in the east of the city. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n<p>Appealing for information online, she said: \u201cMy heart is broken and I wish no one in this world could feel what I feel now.\u201d</p> \n<p>B\u00e9langer\u2019s cousin, C\u00e9line, told RTL radio that he and his friends \u201cbecame separated when the attackers entered the bar.

Next of kin of Xavier Thomas, 45, missing since Saturday\u2019s attack, have been informed, though no formal identification has yet taken place, the Metropolitan police said. Those killed during the London Bridge attack include three French citizens, the French president said. \u201cWe have had confirmation of the new death toll this morning,\u201d Emmanuel Macron said on the steps of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace. \u201cAs far as French nationals are concerned, there have indeed been three fatalities and eight wounded. We are paying a heavy price in these attacks.\u201d Six of those confirmed to have died have now been named by relatives. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said one of the French citizens who had previously been unaccounted for \u201chas been identified among those who have died\u201d. French media reports identified him as S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, who was reported missing by his girlfriend, Gerda Bennet. Another French victim, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, who was working in a French restaurant in Borough Market, has also been named by French media as having died. Thomas, who was in London for the weekend with his girlfriend, is believed to have been thrown into the river Thames after being struck by the speeding van driven along London Bridge in the attack. The family of Sara Zelenak, 21, an au pair from Brisbane, who had been missing since being separated from friends in the chaos of the attack, has confirmed she is also among the dead. Another Australian, Kirsty Boden, a 28-year-old nurse, died as she ran to help others during the attack. She worked as a theatre recovery nurse at Guy\u2019s hospital. \u201cAs she ran towards danger, in an effort to help people on the bridge, Kirsty sadly lost her life,\u201d her family said in a statement. Boden is one of four Australians said to have been caught up in the terror attack. As the process of identifying victims continues, Spanish authorities are still awaiting news of Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda. a 39-year-old missing HSBC banker. The Spanish foreign ministry has said they have no update, and are urging the British authorities to speed up the identification process. The victims Christine Archibald, 30, a Canadian, and Londoner James McMullan, 32, were the first victims to be named by family members. On Monday the family of McMullan, who had been on a night out, said they believed he was among the victims. Although his body has not been formally identified, his sister Melanie McMullan said in a statement that his bank card had been found on a body at the scene, and that the family expected official confirmation on Wednesday. McMullan was described by his sister as \u201csomeone who put friends and family above all else\u201d. She insisted that the family would not be drawn into hatred by the atrocity. \u201cWhile our pain will never diminish, it is important for us to carry on with our lives in direct opposition to those who would try to destroy us, and remember that hatred is the refuge of small-minded individuals, and will only breed more,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not a course we will follow, despite our loss.\u201d Kirsty Boden Boden had been working in London since 2013. In a statement, her family said: \u201cKirsty was loved and adored by her family, friends and boyfriend. She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people. Helping people was what she loved to do in her job as a nurse and in her daily life. \u201cAs she ran towards danger, in an effort to help people on the bridge, Kirsty sadly lost her life. We are so proud of Kirsty\u2019s brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life. Kirsty \u2013 we love you and we will miss you dearly.\u201d She was a keen traveller and in a blog described herself as \u201cjust your average dreamer, with a full-time job and a constant longing to go where I haven\u2019t been\u201d. Recent posts were from Milan, Sofia, Lisbon and Kiev, for the 2017 Eurovision song contest. Urging others to travel, she had written: \u201cAt the risk of sounding cliche, life is short and we should all use the time we have wisely,\u201d The Age reported. Paying tribute, Dame Eileen Sills, the chief nurse at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust said: \u201cKirsty was an outstanding nurse and a hugely valued member of the staff team in Theatres Recovery, described by her colleagues as \u2018one in a million\u2019 who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care.\u201d James McMullan James McMullan, from Hackney in east London, had not been seen since he stepped out of the Barrowboy and Banker pub on Borough High Street for a cigarette five minutes before the attackers crashed their van directly outside. Melissa McMullan had posted an appeal for information about her \u201camazing and incredibly talented big brother\u201d on social media. She said he had been meeting up with school friends and had not been home or in contact since the attack. Friends had checked hospitals without success. The Londoner was about to launch an e-learning business. Reading a statement announcing that James was believed to be among the victims after his bank card was found on one of those killed, Melissa, 30, said: \u201cFrom his friends who were with him on the night, they want everyone to know what a generous and caring friend he was. Words will never be able to match his essence. There will only ever be one James. Nowhere else will you find such humour and unique personality and someone who puts friends and family above all else. He was an inspiration.\u201d Christine Archibald A Canadian victim was named by her family as Christine Archibald, from Castlegar, British Columbia. After graduating in social work from Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, she had worked at a homeless shelter. Her family said: \u201cWe grieve the loss of our beautiful, loving daughter and sister. She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected. \u201cShe lived this belief, working in a shelter for the homeless until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance. She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death. Please honour her by making your community a better place. Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them Chrissy sent you.\u201d Archibald was with her fiance, Tyler Ferguson, when she died. His sister, Cassie Ferguson, told CBC News: \u201cHe is broken into a million pieces. He held her and watched her die in his arms.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was heartbroken at the news. \u201cWe grieve with the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones, and wish all those injured a speedy and full recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cLondoners and people across the United Kingdom have always displayed strength and resilience in the face of adversity. We recently witnessed this after the attacks in Manchester and in the Westminster area of London. This time will be no different.\u201d French victims Three French citizens are believed to have died. Two are confirmed killed, while police searching for a third missing man have recovered a body from the Thames. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said: \u201cIt is with great sadness that I have learned that one of the French citizens, who was previously given as unaccounted for, has been identified among those who have died.\u201d Le Drian did not name the victim but French media identified him as S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, from Angers, a chef at the Coq d\u2019Argent restaurant in the City who friends and relatives said had been watching the Champions league final with friends in a Borough market restaurant called Boro Bistro. B\u00e9langer, who had lived in London for seven years, was reported missing by his girlfriend, Gerda Bennet, a bartender in Hoxton in the east of the city. Appealing for information online, she said: \u201cMy heart is broken and I wish no one in this world could feel what I feel now.\u201d B\u00e9langer\u2019s cousin, C\u00e9line, told RTL radio that he and his friends \u201cbecame separated when the attackers entered the bar. They all ran in different directions to escape, and lost contact with each other\u201d. Le Parisien newspaper said it had confirmed his death late on Tuesday night, adding that his mother and brother were expected to arrive in London on Wednesday. The paper said B\u00e9langer had begun the evening in the The Barrowboy &amp; Banker pub before moving on to the bistro. French media on Tuesday named Alexandre Pigeard, 27, from Normandy, who moved to London two-and-a-half years ago and was working on Saturday night at the Boro Bistro, as also having died. La Manche Libre quoted residents from Pigeard\u2019s home town, Colleville-Montgomery near Caen as saying his death had been confirmed by the mayor. \u201cHe was a kid who wanted to succeed, who loved life,\u201d one resident told the newspaper. The paper said he was a familiar figure in Caen, where he had worked in a number of bars before leaving for the UK. The mother of Vincent Le Berre, a French bar manager at Boro Bistro in Borough market, earlier told Le Telegramme that her son believed a colleague of his, Alexandre, had been killed at the bar. Le Drian said on Monday he had wanted to come to London \u201cto show that France is at Britain\u2019s side. \u201cThe UK has been hit for the third time in less than three months by a terrorist attack. We wanted to show our solidarity to all families of the victims and show we are all concerned by this, and to express our profound compassion.\u201d \u201cAt present the the toll among French citizens of the London attack is two dead and eight injured, including four in a serious condition,\u201d the foreign ministry said. One French national \u201cremains missing\u201d. Xavier Thomas\u2019s next of kin have been informed that the body of a man was found in the river on Tuesday night at 7.44pm near Limehouse by specialist officers from the marine police unit. Thomas, who was in London for the weekend with his girlfriend, has not been seen since Saturday night. His girlfriend, Christine Delcros, was seriously injured. Her sister, Nathalie Cros Brohan, posted online that she was on her way to London to visit Delcros in hospital. She appealed for anyone with news of Thomas to get in touch, adding: \u201cWe are terribly worried.\u201d Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda, 39, from Madrid, who works for HSBC in London, had apparently been skateboarding in a park with friends when he stopped to help a woman who was injured in the atrocity. His family had been asked for fingerprints for identification purposes. Sara Zelenak Australian Sara Zelenak, 21, was last seen running from the attack on London Bridge, where she became separated from friends. Her mother, Julie, who travelled to London, confirmed her death in a Facebook post saying: \u201cSara Zelenak is confirmed dead they found her body &amp; has DNA tests confirmed thank-you for all the overwhelming love &amp; support from everyone.\u201d Zelenak was a nanny, and was supposed to be babysitting on Saturday night but there was a last-minute change of plan. Her mother told Australian radio station 97.3FM her daughter had been travelling in Europe since March, and was working as an au pair in London. She said her daughter had been at Westminster the day before Khalid Masood killed five in a car and knife rampage and had also planned to go to the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, where suicide bomber Salman Abedi murdered 22 victims. \u201cEverything, she\u2019s just missed,\u201d she had said. British Transport Police officer Among the 48 injured were four police officers, including a British Transport Police officer who confronted the terrorists with nothing more than a baton. Theresa May said many of the wounded had sustained life-threatening injuries, while the NHS said at least 21 people were in a critical condition. The BTP chief constable, Paul Crowther, said he had visited his colleague in hospital and he had \u201cshowed enormous courage in the face of danger, as did many others who were at the scene and rushed to help\u201d. \u201cAlthough he is seriously unwell, he was able to recount how he faced the attackers armed only with his baton, outside London Bridge station. For an officer who only joined us less than two years ago, the bravery he showed was outstanding and makes me extremely proud,\u201d he said. A Metropolitan police officer, a rugby player based in Southwark, was off duty and having a drink with friends when he was stabbed tackling one of the three attackers. He is in a serious condition. The Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said: \u201cMy understanding is that, without hesitation, wearing his normal clothes, he dived in and tried to assist, and he I\u2019m afraid was himself severely injured, but utterly heroic.\u201d A further two Met officers were hurt while on duty, one a plain clothes officer who received stitches to a head injury, and a uniformed officer who received an injury to his arm. Man hit by police bullet Mark Rowley, the Met police assistant commissioner, said a member of the public was shot as officers tried to neutralise the terrorists with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of gunfire. Speaking at a press conference, Rowley said the individual was being treated in hospital but was not in a critical condition. He said eight armed officers discharged about 50 bullets as they tried to stop the three knife-wielding attackers. Dr Malik Ramadhan, a senior doctor at the Royal London hospital, told the Guardian the man was shot in the head but was expected to make a full recovery. \u201cWe had one gunshot wound. There\u2019s a patient in this hospital who\u2019s been shot in the head; a man. He\u2019s absolutely not dying. Our expectation is that he will make a full recovery,\u201d said Ramadhan, the divisional director for trauma at the hospital. Daniel O\u2019Neill The mother of one of the victims, 23-year-old Daniel O\u2019Neill, has told of her son\u2019s experience. \u201cHe just stepped outside the bar for a second and a man ran up to him and said \u2018this is for my family, this is for Islam\u2019, and stuck a knife straight in him. He\u2019s got a 7in scar going from his belly round to his back,\u201d Elizabeth O\u2019Neill told reporters outside King\u2019s College hospital. \u201cThe man ran away, Daniel headed back into the pub, there were shots fired, everybody was told to lie down, and then they were told to go downstairs in the bar. At this stage, Daniel\u2019s friend had put a tourniquet on him and was holding pressure there. He was brought downstairs \u2013 parts of that he doesn\u2019t remember \u2013 and then the police were there and brought him in their car to the hospital.\u201d O\u2019Neill said her son could talk but was in shock. \u201cThese people say they are doing this in the name of God, which is an absolute joke. They are callous, they are barbaric and they are absolute cowards. We will carry on as normal,\u201d she said. London hospitals, including King\u2019s College hospital, the Royal London and St Thomas\u2019s confirmed they were among those treating the injured, though a number had now been discharged. Geoff Ho Geoff Ho, the Sunday Express business editor, was taken to intensive care after being stabbed in the throat when he tried to help a wounded bouncer. He was filmed being led away from the scene by a police officer, clutching his neck and with his shirt off. According to the Mirror, he wrote on Facebook: \u201cDon\u2019t know whether it was stupid or noble to jump in and break up the fight outside the Southwark Tavern, but two a***s trying to do over the lone bouncer on the door isn\u2019t happening on my watch.\u201d His friend, Isabelle Oderberg, tweeted: \u201cWe have found Geoff. He is in intensive care.\u201d She told the Melbourne newspaper the Age: \u201cHe is actually a martial artist and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he would have stood up and been counted because he\u2019s just that type of person.\u201d From his hospital bed, Ho wrote: \u201cThe bastard in the Arsenal shirt came at me first. I think I got a hit in on one of them, but either he or his accomplice got me with a shot to the throat.\u201d On Tuesday morning Ho tweeted: Antonis Filis Antonis Filis, a Greek national who works in London, is recovering in hospital after being stabbed in the kidney. Greece\u2019s state news agency said Filis, who also sustained head injuries, had been with his girlfriend in Borough Market. According to Greek local media, Filis\u2019s parents, Giorgos and Grazia-Maria, heard the news from his girlfriend. Filis lived close to Borough Market and his father sent a message to check that he was all right. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get an answer, and then a little while later we saw a call come in from his phone. A girl said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, he is well, he has been injured,\u2019\u201d Giorgos Filis told Lamia Report, a news outlet in the central Greek town. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish it on any parent to be faced with the feeling that we had \u2026 he stared at death in the face \u2026 he said they were aiming for his carotid \u2013 with God\u2019s help and with him throwing up his hand [in front of his face], he was hit on the head. If it had been a little bit lower we don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d Filis required eight stitches to his head and several hours of surgery after being knifed in the kidney. His father said he was now out of danger. Brett Freeman Brett Freeman, from Dagenham, east London, was stabbed four times according to friend Darren Mole. Mole tweeted: Mole posted a picture of Freeman in his hospital bed. Candice Hedge, 31 Kim del Toro, the mother of Candice Hedge from Australia who was named as one of those hurt in the attack, told Fairfax Media that her daughter had received emergency surgery at St Thomas\u2019s hospital, and said: \u201cShe is going to be fine, thank goodness.\u201d The Brisbane Courier Mail said Hedge had finished her waiting shift at Elliot\u2019s restaurant and was having a drink at the bar when a man came up behind her, grabbed her head and slashed at her throat. Del Toro said Hedge had been at the bar with her boyfriend, Luke, when \u201che heard some commotion out the front and went out to see what was going on\u201d. \u201cHe saw some men with knives coming toward them, and he ran back inside to see where Candice was.\u201d She said he had been unable to find her, and the police had yelled for everyone to stay down. He had then seen his girlfriend running towards him, holding her bleeding neck. Del Toro said her daughter had been able to make a Skype call on Sunday morning. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t speak, but I got to see her and she gave me the thumbs up, so I knew that she was OK.\u201d Hedge also posted on Facebook to reassure friends, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She wrote: \u201cI\u2019m doing OK. Still in hospital, but all in the clear. I really can\u2019t talk. The f----- stabbed me in the neck. Don\u2019t worry too much. I love you all.\u201d Andrew Morrison In a video posted on Reddit, Morrison, from Darwin, Australia, who had a bloodstained cloth wrapped around his neck, said he had been stabbed after leaving Belushi\u2019s bar where he had been watching the Champions League final. \u201cAll of a sudden this guy comes up with a knife \u2026 I push him off. I walk into a pub and say: \u2018Someone help me, I\u2019ve been stabbed,\u2019\u201d he said on the video. Morrison\u2019s sister Katrina told the NT News the family was just happy he was safe. \u201cYes, my brother was involved,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently sorting out his flight home.\u201d Oliver Dowling and Marie Bondeville Oliver Dowling, 32, from Christchurch, New Zealand, was recovering from four hours of surgery after being stabbed in the face, neck and stomach. According to the New Zealand Herald, his sister Freddy posted on Facebook: \u201cDoctors are very happy with how he\u2019s come out the other side. A massive thanks to the University of London hospital for their tireless efforts in helping my brother out!\u201d His girlfriend, Marie Bondeville, was also injured, she wrote, adding: \u201cMarie has been in surgery at another hospital but unfortunately we haven\u2019t been able to find out how she is due to not being immediate family.\u201d Roy Larner Larner, 47, from Peckham, was stabbed eight times as he fought with the trio of attackers at the Black &amp; Blue bar in Borough Market. They shouted: \u201cThis is for Allah\u201d and \u201cIslam, Islam, Islam,\u201d he told the Sun. He said he shouted back: \u201cFuck you, I\u2019m Millwall,\u201d before trying to punch them.

One member of the public was caught in the gunfire when a bullet struck him in the head. A senior doctor at the Royal London hospital in east London said the man was expected to make a full recovery. A British Transport Police officer armed only with his baton was stabbed in the face as he tackled the assailants. He suffered serious injuries, but is in a stable condition in hospital. An off-duty Metropolitan police officer was among others injured in the attack. Two more on-duty officers were described as \u201cwalking wounded\u201d. At least four Australian citizens were injured, according to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Among them, Candice Hedge from Brisbane was stabbed in the neck and is recovering after being treated in St Thomas\u2019 hospital. A man from New Zealand also suffered serious wounds in the attack. At least four French citizens were harmed, one seriously. Geoff Ho, a journalist with the Sunday Express, was left in intensive care after being stabbed in the throat when he tried to help a wounded bouncer. Police raided two more properties in Newham and Barking in east London early on Monday morning. Counter-terrorist officers detained \u201ca number of people\u201d, the Metropolitan police said. The Met arrested 12 people on Sunday after an operation in Barking in east London. One person, a 55-year-old man, has since been released. On Sunday morning, police raided a block of flats in the area where at least one of the suspects is thought to have lived. Another raid, at a flat in nearby East Ham, followed in the afternoon. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street after she had chaired a meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, Theresa May condemned Islamist extremism and called the ideology a \u201cperversion of Islam\u201d. She said there was \u201ca new trend in the threat we face,\u201d with terrorism breeding terrorism. \u201cIt is time to say enough is enough,\u201d she added. The prime minister said there must be changes on four fronts: first, people who are drawn to Islamist extremism must be persuaded that western values are superior. Second, there must be a clampdown on the \u201csafe spaces\u201d on the internet where terrorism breeds. Third, she called for action at home where extremism may be tolerated. \u201cThere is \u2013 to be frank \u2013 far too much tolerance of extremism in our country,\u201d she said. Finally, she proposed a review of counter-terrorism strategy and laws, and suggested longer sentences for some offences. She confirmed that the general election would go ahead on Thursday as planned. After a brief suspension in election campaigning in the wake of the attack a bitter row erupted over cuts to police funding, with Jeremy Corbyn backing calls for May to resign over her record on the issue while she was home secretary. The prime minister dodged accusations that police numbers had fallen by tens of thousands since 2010 and that the number of armed officers had also fallen. On a visit to London Bridge on Monday, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was \u201cfurious that these three men are seeking to justify their actions by using the faith that I belong to. The ideology they follow is perverse, it is poisonous, and it has no place in Islam.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn delivered a speech on the attack in Carlisle on Sunday evening. He said that, if he won the election, he would commission a report on Friday on the changing nature of the terrorist threat. He also used the speech to criticise May for ignoring warnings about the impact of police cuts, as well as to criticise the US president, Donald Trump, for his comments about the London Bridge attack. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre at MI5 headquarters has recommended not to raise the official threat level from severe to critical, suggesting that it believes no more terrorists are at large. The UK will observe a minute\u2019s silence on Tuesday 6 June at 11am in remembrance of those who have lost their lives and all others affected by the attacks. Flags will remain at half-mast on Whitehall government buildings until Tuesday evening. The Home Office has set up a website with information about the support available for people affected by the attacks. A statement from the office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed that French citizens were among the injured. He condemned \u201can abominable and cowardly attack against our free society\u201d. Pictures have been circulating showing a suspect on the ground in the market. He appears to have canisters strapped to his body. Police say those canisters were part of a fake suicide vest. The use of fake bomb vests was designed to \u201cspread panic and fear\u201d, the prime minister said. The identity of the man is believed to be known by several media outlets, including the Guardian, but they have chosen not to name him in accordance with police wishes. Two people have said they alerted police about his extreme views and he is also believed to have featured in a documentary entitled Jihadis Next Door broadcast on Channel 4 last year, in which he was part of a group involved in a confrontation with officers. Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported that police in Ireland have confirmed that an Irish identity card was found on one of the three attackers shot dead. Concrete barriers have been installed on Westminster, Lambeth and Waterloo bridges to stop traffic from mounting the pavement in the wake of Saturday\u2019s attack after the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, said there would be \u201cincreased physical measures\u201d . Borough station reopened on Sunday evening. The cordon remained in place on Monday but London Bridge station reopened.",

But I think what is on the table is a much tighter view about the way we got about this Tpim stuff.</p> \n   <p>One of the things that I was concerned about in coalition \u2013 I know Theresa May was when she was home secretary \u2013 was during the coalition the Tpim order that we brought in, which gives those powers, was watered down. And I think it was weakened too much.</p> \n   <p>The general sense is, and I think this is the feeling also within the security services, is that, if you think about it, they are watching at least 500 people, every hour of every day. And then there are thousands more that they need to watch, but it\u2019s just not feasible ... So what they need to be able to do is lesson the burden on themselves by, those who they are most concerned about, putting them in a place where they cannot do anything. That allows them to go wider, to investigate and look further ahead at the others.</p> \n   <p>And I think this is really what Theresa May is getting to. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There are several differences between Tpims and control orders but a crucial one is that control orders allowed \u201cinvoluntary relocation\u201d. A suspect living in London could be ordered to go and live somewhere else, where he would be out of touch with his associates. Duncan Smith is implying (when he talks about suspects being \u201cput in a place where they cannot do anything\u201d) that May wants to reintroduce this power</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Duncan Smith suggests May wants to beef up Tpims to allow suspects to be forced to move home.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is from <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06799#fullreport\">a Commons library note (pdf)</a> explaining the differences between control orders and Tpims.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The measures that may be imposed under [Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act] are finite, unlike those under the [Prevention of Terrorism Act], and are less intrusive in certain respects.</p> \n   <p>Involuntary relocation is no longer permitted. This was one of the most controversial aspects of the control order regime, and relocation requirements were struck down by the courts in several cases. Overnight residence requirements which are permitted for Tpim subjects must be based somewhere in which the subject has a residence or connection. </p> \n   <p>Curfews of up to 16 hours are replaced by \u201covernight residence requirements\u201d. The power to confine persons to a particular area is replaced by a power to exclude them from particular specified areas or places.</p> \n   <p>The power to ban all electronic communications is replaced by a provision that requires the subject to be allowed the use of a fixed line and a mobile telephone, and a computer with internet access.</p> \n   <p>Police searches for the purpose of determining whether there is compliance with Tpims now require a warrant from the appropriate judicial authority. Measures to prohibit and vet visitors and meetings are relaxed. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-04T14:21:44.263Z\">at 3.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-593403dbe4b0be3ed1922d12\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-04T12:59:59.584Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">British Transport Police officer in stable condition - force chief</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The British Transport Police (BTP) officer injured as he confronted terrorists with nothing but his baton is in a stable condition, the force chief said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The BTP chief constable, Paul Crowther, said: \u201cHaving visited the officer in hospital shortly after he was admitted for treatment, I was able to hear his account of what happened last night.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt became clear that he showed enormous courage in the face of danger, as did many others who were at the scene and rushed to help.

The attacker lunged at one of the policemen but the other knelt on the floor and fired two shots at the attacker, taking him out instantly.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHe died there on the pub floor,\u201d said Bennett. \u201dThe police came in and covered the body and the paramedics came in to help the people who hadn\u2019t escaped through the back door.

After the Westminster and Manchester Arena attacks there were no calls for new anti-terror laws. In fact, after Manchester, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2017/may/24/manchester-arena-bombing-terror-attack-victims-threat-critical-ariana-grande-concert-live-news?page=with:block-59253d0fe4b0662750017021#block-59253d0fe4b0662750017021\">Amber Rudd, the home secretary, specifically said that the police and the intelligence services were not asking for news powers.</a></p> \n  <p>Now May has changed tack. \u201cThings cannot continue as they are,\u201d she said in a speech that proposed a new legislative blitz against terror. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May said terror laws needed to be overhauled because Britain faced new types of terror attack.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of their planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected but we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face. </p> \n   <p>As terrorism breeds terrorism and perpetrators are inspired to attack, not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots after years of planning and training, and not even as lone attackers radicalised online, but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack.</p> \n   <p>We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are. Things need to change and they need to change in four important ways. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May said the government needed to redouble efforts to stop people being being radicalised.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First, while the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division and promotes sectarianism. </p> \n   <p>It is an ideology that claims our western values of freedom, democracy and human rights are incompatible with the religion of Islam. It is an ideology that is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth. </p> \n   <p>Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time, but it cannot be defeated by military intervention alone. It will not be defeated by the maintenance of a permanent defensive counter-terrorism operation, however skillful its leaders and practitioners.</p> \n   <p>It will only be defeated when we turn people\u2019s minds away from this violence and make them understand that our values \u2013 pluralistic British values \u2013 are superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>May may have been referring to government plans to reboot the Prevent programme later this year.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said she was committed to working with other governments to get internet companies to do more to tackle extremism online.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Second, we cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide. We need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning.</p> \n   <p>And we need to do everything we can at home to reduce the risks of extremism online. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/26/theresa-may-calls-g7-leaders-help-prosecute-foreign-fighters\">an initiative that May was pushing at the G7 summit last month.</a> At the G7 summit, May was focusing on getting internet companies to remove extremism content. In her interview with Peston on Sunday just now,<strong> Amber Rudd</strong>, the home secretary, signalled that the government would revive its attempt to get internet firms to allow the security services access to encrypted messages. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2017/jun/03/london-bridge-closed-after-serious-police-incident-live?page=with:block-5933d8bae4b0be3ed1922c38#block-5933d8bae4b0be3ed1922c38\">10.57am.)</a> Rudd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/26/intelligence-services-access-whatsapp-amber-rudd-westminster-attack-encrypted-messaging\">floated this idea after the Westminster attack,</a> although campaigners and internet companies say her demands are unrealistic and disproportionate.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>May said there was \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism in our country\u201d and that she wanted to stamp it out.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Third, while we need to deprive the extremists of their safe spaces online, we must not forget about the safe spaces that continue to exist in the real world. Yes, that means taking military action to destroy Isis in Iraq and Syria. But it also means taking action here at home.</p> \n   <p>While we have made significant progress in recent years, there is \u2013 to be frank \u2013 far too much tolerance of extremism in our country. So we need to become far more robust in identifying it and stamping it out across the public sector and across society.</p> \n   <p>That will require some difficult, and often embarrassing, conversations. But the whole of our country needs to come together to take on this extremism, and we need to live our lives not in a series of separated, segregated communities, but as one truly United Kingdom.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This suggests that May is determined to revive plans for a counter-extremism bill. After the 2015 general election, David Cameron\u2019s government proposed a counter-extremism bill in two successive Queen\u2019s speeches but the law never materialised, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/29/theresa-may-counter-terrorism-bill-sinking-without-trace-extremism-british-values\">reportedly because government lawyers could not come up with a definition of \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d</a>, which the bill was supposed to target.</p> \n  <p>The Conservative manifesto includes plans to address extremism. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>To defeat extremism, we need to learn from how civil society and the state took on racism in the twentieth century. We will consider what new criminal offences might need to be created, and what new aggravated offences might need to be established, to defeat the extremists. We will support the public sector and civil society in identifying extremists, countering their messages and promoting pluralistic, British values. And we will establish a Commission for Countering Extremism to identify examples of extremism and expose them, to support the public sector and civil society, and help the government to identify policies to defeat extremism and promote pluralistic values. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the Tories have not said what these new criminal offences might be, or what \u201cexposing\u201d extremism might mean. May\u2019s language this morning is much blunter and more aggressive. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She proposed a review of counter-terror laws and floated the prospect of toughening sentences, including for \u201capparently less serious\u201d terror offences. </strong>She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Fourth, we have a robust counter-terrorism strategy, that has proved successful over many years. But as the nature of the threat we face becomes more complex, more fragmented, more hidden, especially online, the strategy needs to keep up.</p> \n   <p>So in light of what we are learning about the changing threat, we need to review Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy to make sure the police and security services have all the powers they need. </p> \n   <p>And if we need to increase the length of custodial sentences for terrorist-related offences \u2013 even apparently less serious offences - that is what we will do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This goes beyond what the Conservatives proposed in their manifesto.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>She said that since the Westminster attack in March \u201cthe security and intelligence agencies and police have disrupted five credible plots\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec26f3a50540c599af58c0dcf679bc867fd64321\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec26f3a50540c599af58c0dcf679bc867fd64321/0_212_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May speaking outside 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May speaking outside 10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Coombs/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-04T11:15:43.414Z\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5933e54fe4b0bdd87e2f320e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-04T10:49:14.053Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A woman from Brisbane is among two Australians injured in the attack, <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/london-terror-attack-queensland-victim-candice-hedge-stabbed-in-the-neck/news-story/ed9793ccc5b90b0ae427b212aca8c3c1?utm_content=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=EditorialSF&amp;utm_source=CourierMail&amp;utm_medium=Twitter\">according to the Brisbane Courier Mail.</a> Candice Hedge, 31, was dining in London on Saturday night with her boyfriend when she was stabbed in the neck.

About 45 minutes later she heard \u201canother pop \u2013 it felt like gunshots\u201d, she said.</p> \n  <p>Smith had found her way home after fleeing the area earlier in the evening. She had been on a date in the Slug and Lettuce on Borough High Street when it became clear something was going on outside. \u201cWe were just talking and then suddenly I heard people gather around the window facing Borough High Street,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople were like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Somebody said, \u2018Run! Run!\u2019 We thought there was a fight outside so we didn\u2019t bother, but then the staff were shouting, \u2018Leave, run now.\u2019\u201d Police were standing in the middle of the street, she said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m really surprised how quickly police managed to get here \u2013 there was car after car,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Smith remembers a policewoman shouting, \u201cRun as fast as you can. Run for your life.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo we didn\u2019t know what we were running from. It was quite unsettling. You half expected gunshots from the back.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She continued: \u201cThe most shocking moment was a woman aged 40-45 in a pink top crying. I hugged her and said are you all right. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen someone being stabbed.\u2019\u201d</p> \n  <p>As Smith and her date headed south towards Borough station, police along the way urged the crowd to hurry. \u201cThe police kept saying all the way down ... \u2018Run, keep running, keep moving. Get somewhere safe. Clear the area.\u2019</p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople were crying, people had lost their friends and couldn\u2019t get in touch with them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>They were told to get on to the tube as soon as possible if they needed to travel. \u201cWe still didn\u2019t know what was happening. We went straight to the tube \u2013 staff were really good, very protective.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A train approached but didn\u2019t stop, and staff said the station would probably close soon. Buses had also stopped, she said. \u201cSo we were kind of stuck in the area ... we wanted to hide somewhere in a small corner or a pub but we thought anyone could storm in and start shooting.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Despite the chaos, Smith remembers feeling oddly calm. \u201cI was laughing \u2013 that was my defensive reaction,\u201d she said.

Terrorist attacks until this year were restricted to single fatalities. Among them were the 2007 attack on Glasgow airport in which only the attacker was killed; a Ukrainian rightwing extremist who stabbed a man to death in Birmingham in 2013 and attacked mosques with homemade bombs; the two men who killed the soldier Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013; and the murder of MP Jo Cox last year.</p> \n  <p>Since March there has been the Westminster attack by Khalid Masood, who mowed down pedestrians near parliament and stabbed a policeman, resulting in six deaths, including his own: and the Manchester bombing two weeks ago that killed 22.

          "bodyText": "Rolling coverage continues on our new live blog: Isis has claimed responsibility for Saturday\u2019s attack, although this has not been verified. In a statement published late on Sunday by the Amaq news agency, which usually carries its claims, it said: A detachment of Islamic State fighters executed yesterday\u2019s London attack. Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said detectives were urgently investigating whether the three terror suspects were \u201cassisted or supported\u201d by a wider network. The names of the three men have not been released. Police say they believe all the attackers were killed after armed officers \u201cfired an unprecedented number of rounds\u201d to shoot them dead during their attack on Borough Market. One of the suspected attackers was described by neighbours as a married father of two who attended local mosques. One neighbour told the Guardian she had reported the man to police two years ago after fears he was attempting to radicalise children. Read more. Writing in the Times today, Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, says he agrees with Theresa May that British Muslims need to do more to tackle extremism: Speaking as a Muslim myself, we need to ask ourselves searching questions \u2026 There\u2019s no avoiding the fact that these people think they are Muslims. They identify as Muslims. And they carry out their attacks \u2013 ignorantly, offensively \u2013 in the name of Islam. That\u2019s why, although we all share the responsibility for tackling terrorism, there\u2019s a special, unique burden on the Muslim community \u2026 We need them to set off on the path to peace rather than the road to war. We need to offer not just a counternarrative, which rebuts the extremists, but a positive and self-confident narrative that promotes pluralistic, British values \u2013 and their compatibility with an Islamic life. And that message can best come from within the Muslim community. Gerard Vowls was heading home after a football game when he found himself in the middle of the attack. He attempted to distract the terrorists by shouting at them and throwing bar stools and bottles at them: \u201cI was just throwing it at them, trying to get them to chase me so I could get them out into the main road, draw them out to the main road to where the police could see them.\u201d Seven people were killed, and 48 injured people were taken to hospital. Of these, 21 are in a critical condition. Only one of those killed has so far been named: a Canadian woman, Christine Archibald, from Castlegar, British Columbia. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, confirmed that a French man was among those killed, but he has not been named. Seven other French citizens were reported to have been injured, four of them critically. Two Australians \u2013 Candice Hedge, from Brisbane, and Andrew Morrison, from Darwin \u2013 were wounded, and the Canberra government says there are two more \u201cabout whom we have very real concerns\u201d. An off-duty Metropolitan police officer and a British Transport police officer who confronted the terrorists with a baton were injured. A British man was shot in the head by a stray police bullet but was not severely injured and is expected to make a full recovery. New Zealander Oliver Dowling was stabbed in the face, neck and stomach. His partner Marie Bondeville was also injured. Geoff Ho, a Sunday Express journalist, was in intensive care after being stabbed in the throat. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has suggested that four Australians could be among those injured or killed in the London attack. Two \u2013 Candice Hedge, from Brisbane, and Andrew Morrison, from Darwin \u2013 have already been identified among those wounded in the attack. Now Turnbull says there are two more \u201cabout whom we have very real concerns\u201d. Japan has warned its nationals to avoid places it says could be \u201cpotential targets\u201d in London, including sightseeing spots, department stores, markets, concert venues and political rallies. The country\u2019s foreign ministry said in a travel advisory that Japanese visitors to Britain should \u201cpay close attention to their surroundings, and leave quickly if they see anything suspicious\u201d. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has voiced solidarity with the British people in a message to Theresa May. Abe offered his condolences to the victims of Saturday\u2019s attack, adding: \u201cI express solidarity with the people of Britain at this difficult time.\u201d Abe said: \u201cJapan is determined to fight terrorism, working hand in hand with Britain and other members of the international community.\u201d We have some further information on the 12 arrests made by police on Sunday investigating the London Bridge attack. Four addresses were raided in east London, but at two of those properties nobody was arrested. Twelve people were arrested at the two other addresses. Of the 12, seven are women, aged between 19 and 60. Five men, aged between 28 and 55, were also detained, but one \u2013 a 55-year-old man \u2013 has already been released without charge. Eleven remain in custody. All are detained on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act, which means they can be held for up to two weeks before a decision must be made whether to charge or release them. On Monday, the first funeral of one of the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack will take place. Eilidh MacLeod, who was 14, will be remembered in a ceremony at Church of Our Lady, Star of the Sea in Castlebay on the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides. Her friend Laura MacIntyre was badly injured in the bombing and remains in hospital. Eilidh\u2019s parents, Roddy and Marion MacLeod, paid tribute to her ahead of the funeral: Two weeks ago today we lost our darling daughter and sister, Eilidh MacLeod, in one of the cruellest ways possible. Most of Eilidh\u2019s happiest times were spent in the Western Isles, particularly Barra and Vatersay, with her friends and family, so we are pleased to have her back home among those she loved so much. Today, as we take Eilidh on her final journey, our one hope is that her funeral is a real celebration of her life and the wonderful person she was. Eilidh\u2019s infectious personality touched everyone she met and it has been a privilege and an honour to have her as our daughter. We will always remember her as a truly beautiful girl inside and out, eternally young, loved by all and forever in our hearts. One of the seven victims killed in Saturday night\u2019s attack has been named as Christine Archibald, who was from Canada. Her family has issued a statement asking people to \u201chonour her by making your community a better place\u201d: We grieve the loss of our beautiful, loving daughter and sister. She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected. She lived this belief, working in a shelter for the homeless until she moved to Europe to be with her fianc\u00e9. She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death. Please honour her by making your community a better place. Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter. Tell them Chrissy sent you. Joining Ariana Grande for the One Love Manchester concert on Sunday night were \u2013 among others \u2013 Katy Perry, Coldplay, Liam Gallagher, Take That, Robbie Williams, Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus. Here\u2019s a quick run-through the highlights: 12 people were arrested by police on Sunday after searches in east London. One 55-year-old man was later released without charge. Seven women and four men, aged between 19 and 60, remain in custody. According to White House pool reporters, Donald Trump has been speaking again about the attack on London: President Trump described the London attack as a \u201chorrific terrrorist attack\u201d and said he spoke with PM May to \u201cexpress our unwavering support\u201d. President said the US will do everything in its power to \u201cbring those that are guilty to justice\u201d. Trump said: \u201cAmerica sends our thoughts and prayers. \u201cWe renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life. And it has gone on too long. This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end. As president I will do what is necessary to prevent this threat from spreading to our shores.\u201d Andrew Morrison, who was stabbed in the attack, has described how he got away from one of the London Bridge attackers. The Australian was walking across the street after watching the Champions League final when \u201call of a sudden a guy comes up [with] a knife\u201d. Morrison is one of three Australians known to have been caught up in the rampage that started on London Bridge. This video contains strong language. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, appeared on stage at the One Love Manchester concert tonight and sent a message of support to London: We have received so many messages in recent days, so tonight, Manchester, let\u2019s send our own to our friends in London who are going through the same as we were going through. We know how you are feeling but we will stand with you and we will get through this together. There was an increased police presence, too, at the One Love Manchester concert \u2013 and many officers took the chance to show the positive spirit that infused the event: My colleague Chris Johnston reports that there remains a strong police presence around central London tonight \u2013 a van containing several officers is parked on Blackfriars bridge, for example. Three Australians are believed to have been caught up in the London Bridge terrorism attack, Julie Bishop has said. The foreign minister told ABC radio on Monday she had spoken to the father of an Australian woman who is recovering in hospital, while another who received stitches was on his way back home. \u201cWe\u2019re still making inquiries in respect to the circumstances of the third Australian,\u201d Bishop said after speaking to the high commissioner in London, Alexander Downer. A Brisbane woman, Candice Hedge, 30, was badly wounded when she was slashed in the throat in Saturday\u2019s deadly attack. She is recovering in St Thomas\u2019s hospital in London. Hedge\u2019s mother, Kim del Toro, told Fairfax Media her daughter had received emergency surgery but \u201cshe is going to be fine, thank goodness\u201d. Also injured was Andrew Morrison, from Darwin. In a video posted on Reddit, Morrison, who had a blood-stained cloth wrapped around his neck, said he had been stabbed after leaving Belushi\u2019s bar in London Bridge where he had been watching the Champions League final. \u201cAll of a sudden this guy comes up with a knife \u2026 I push him off. I walk into a pub and say, \u2018Someone help me, I\u2019ve been stabbed,\u2019\u201d he said on the video. In a speech in Carlisle on Sunday night, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Theresa May of attempting to protect the public \u201con the cheap\u201d, following Saturday\u2019s terror attack in London. Urging the British people to \u201cstand together\u201d, Corbyn said the police and security services \u201cmust get the resources they need\u201d to safeguard the country. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog again. CBC News in Canada has more details on Chrissy Archibald, named as one of the victims who died in the London attack. CBC reports: The Canadian woman who was killed during the attack in London died in her fianc\u00e9\u2019s arms on London Bridge, according to her future sister-in-law. Christine Archibald, from Castlegar, British Columbia, was among the seven people killed in what UK prime minister Theresa May has described as a \u201cbrutal terrorist attack\u201d. Archibald was engaged to Tyler Ferguson. His sister, Cassie Ferguson, said her brother was with Archibald on London Bridge during the attack. \u201cHe is broken into a million pieces,\u201d Ferguson told CBC News in a Facebook Messenger conversation. \u201cHe held her and watched her die in his arms.\u201d That\u2019s it from me - my colleague Claire Phipps is taking over now. Our picture editor Arnel Hecimovic has compiled a gallery of images from the Manchester concert on Sunday night: The Met has given an update for residents in the Borough area, some of whom face a second night unable to return home. As we head into Monday, this is the front page of tomorrow\u2019s print edition of the Guardian: Former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweets: Speaking of the concert, event organisers said \u00a32m had been raised by text and online donations during the three-hour broadcast. The British Red Cross said more than \u00a310m had been raised for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund in total. Meanwhile, Ariana Grande said in a tweet on Saturday that she was re-releasing One Last Time as a charity single, with proceeds going towards the campaign. If you missed the Manchester One Love concert this evening, here are some highlights: London Bridge station will be exit-only when it reopens on Monday morning from 5am. The Islamic State terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack in London on Saturday night that killed seven and left 21 fighting for their lives. The head of the Site intelligence group says the terror group claimed its fighters carried out the attack. \u201cA detachment of Islamic State fighters executed yesterday\u2019s London attack,\u201d said a statement posted on the militant group\u2019s Amaq media agency website. A producer at Canada\u2019s CTV News has tweeted a statement from the family of Chrissy Archibald, who was one of the victims of last night\u2019s attack in London. She was from Castlegar in British Columbia. Further detail from the Met police statement about the 12 arrests today. A 38-year-old woman was arrested at \u201caddress 1\u201d in Barking. A further 11 people were arrested at \u201caddress 2\u201d in Barking. They included five males: a 28-year-old man, a 52-year-old man, a 55-year-old man, a 27-year-old man, and a 55-year-old man who has since been released without charge. Six women were also arrested at \u201caddress 2\u201d: a 49-year-old woman, a 60-year-old, a 19-year-old woman, a 27-year-old female, a 24-year-old female, and a 53-year-old woman. Good news for commuters: Met police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley has issued a statement: We would like to thank the media for their continued support, restraint and understanding in not speculating as to who the suspects are in this fast-moving investigation. I would like to assure them and the public that this is directly assisting the progression of the investigation and confirm we will release the identities of the three men directly responsible for the attacks yesterday, Saturday 3 June, as soon as operationally possible. Officers have been working tirelessly to process the crime scenes and release the cordons. We are hopeful that some of the cordons around London Bridge station will be released during the course of tomorrow morning, but consult TfL website before you set out on your journeys into and around London tomorrow. The public can expect to see additional police \u2013 both armed and unarmed officers \u2013 across the capital as you would expect in these circumstances, and our security and policing plans for events are being reviewed. The public will also see increased physical measures on London\u2019s bridges to keep the public safe. Officers have made 12 arrests and are at present searching four properties. There have been no arrests at two residential addresses in Newham, although a number of people have been spoken to. During the arrest stage today, no officers have deployed a Taser electronic weapon or a firearm. All of those arrested have been detained under the Terrorism Act. Ariana Grande has performed her hit One Last Time and is now giving us a rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow to end the show in Manchester. The singer was overcome with emotion at one point during the song and had to pause before regaining her composure to continue. Back to the hits now for Liam with the Oasis hit Live Forever. No sign of Noel, but Chris Martin from Coldplay has strapped on an acoustic guitar and popped back on stage. Song number two from the former Oasis frontman is his, erm, new single Wall of Glass. Liam Gallagher is one of the surprise guests at the Manchester concert and has opened with Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Star. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has tweeted tonight: Ariana Grande says she was inspired to change her set list for the One Love Manchester concert after the mother of one of the teenage victims said her daughter would have wanted to hear the hits. Grande appeared on stage at the Emirates Old Trafford cricket ground in an an oversized white One Love Manchester sweatshirt and seemed overcome by emotion at points as she was joined by a string of musical stars. She told the crowd: \u201cI want to thank you so much for coming tonight and being so happy and strong and unified. I love you guys so much. This night is the kind of thing the world really needs right now.\u201d Grande said she had not planned to play so many of her big hits but changed her mind after meeting the mother of Olivia Campbell-Hardy, 15, who was among the victims of the blast that killed 22 people at at her concert last week. She said: \u201cI had the pleasure of meeting Olivia\u2019s mummy a few days ago and I started to cry and gave her a big hug and she said, \u2018Stop crying, because Olivia wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to cry.\u2019 \u201cAnd then she told me Olivia would have wanted to hear the hits. We had a different show planned and we had a rehearsal yesterday and we changed everything.\u201d Coldplay are now on stage in Manchester and playing hits including Viva la Vida. Shortly before 9pm a white, contained flatbed truck was seen leaving London Bridge, going north, with what is thought to have been the terrorists\u2019 van inside. Justin Bieber is now on stage and says it\u2019s an honour to be performing at the Manchester concert. He has a guitar. That can only mean it\u2019s time for his downbeat hit Love Yourself. Efforts to prevent people turning to terrorism will be stepped up in the wake of the London Bridge attack, one of the UK\u2019s largest Islamic organisations has said. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) condemned Saturday\u2019s atrocity at London Bridge, which has claimed the lives of at least seven people, as an \u201coutrage\u201d and said it would launch a new grassroots campaign to make sure that suspicious activity is reported to the authorities. \u201cLast night, we witnessed \u2013 once again \u2013 horror inflicted on our streets. This is the third time in as many months. They are truly shocking and we condemn them in the strongest terms,\u201d said its secretary-general, Harun Khan. He said the UK needed to \u201cstand together, and for our part, in particular, we can work harder to help our young people relate to this country and the faith which has the tools to make them modern citizens\u201d. While he condemned the attack, Khan said it was not for the Muslim community as a whole to apologise for it, because only the attackers were responsible for their actions. \u201cIt is my duty as a Muslim \u2013 and for every Muslim \u2013 to stand up and condemn a wrongful deed ... It is a duty of every Muslim to speak out against this kind of injustice. So, I am not apologising for what they have done and nobody should have to apologise for them because they made a choice to do something. But, what I can do as a citizen and as a Muslim is condemn their actions.\u201d The pop megastar Katy Perry \u2013 sporting an arresting peroxide crew cut hairdo no less \u2013 has just hit the stage in Manchester with an acoustic version of her hit Part of Me. \u201cI encourage you to choose love, even when that is difficult,\u201d she tells the crowd. BBC pop writer Mark Savage is watching the Manchester concert on BBC1: Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas told the crowd at the fundraising concert: \u201cManchester, London, we are here together and we are one.\u201d Ariana Grande then introduced Imogen Heap, who sat at the piano to sing Whatcha Say before a video message from David Beckham was played. He said: \u201cAs a father, what happened made me truly sad and it\u2019s a day we\u2019ll never forget. I\u2019m proud of everyone there today, everyone in the crowd and all the artists.\u201d Grande later joined a choir from Parrs Wood high school on stage, who sang their own version of her song, My Everything, before she welcomed her boyfriend Mac Miller on to the stage, saying: \u201cTonight is all about love, am I right?\u201d The pair danced together as they performed their 2013 collaboration The Way and Miller\u2019s track Dang! Ariana Grande has just finished performing with the Black Eyed Peas at the Manchester One Love concert, where the crowd was treated to their megahit Where is the Love? Police were warned about the main suspect radicalising children in a local park two years ago, a neighbour has revealed. Erica Gasparri, an Italian mother of three who lives in the same complex, said she confronted the man, known locally as \u201cAbs\u201d, after her son came home and said: \u201cMummy, I want to be a Muslim.\u201d Gasparri then went to the park, where she said a \u201cPakistani man\u201d had stated: \u201cI\u2019m ready to do whatever I need to do in the name of Allah. I am ready in the name of Allah to do what needs to be done, including killing my own mother.\u201d She said: \u201cI took four photographs of him and gave them to the police. They rang Scotland Yard when I was there and said the information had been passed on to Scotland Yard. They were very concerned. They told me to delete the photos for my own safety which I did but then I heard nothing. That was two years ago. No-one came to me. If they did this could have been prevented and lives could have been saved. \u201cHe would go down to the park and talk to them about Islam and he also came to the houses and gave the kids money and sweets during Ramadan.\u201d Gasparri said she told other neighbours including a Polish woman, who then tipped off the suspect that he had been reported to police. Today that woman said she was sorry: \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was a bad guy. Maybe I was blind.\u201d In a stand-up row near the suspect\u2019s flat on Sunday evening, Erica told the Polish woman: \u201cMy first impressions was he was a terrorist radicaliser.\u201d Met Police said they were aware of the claims, but had no comment at this stage, as they had not released any information about any of the suspects. Much praise on Twitter for this tweet from the US Embassy in London, which is somewhat different in tone to those from President Trump earlier in the day. Little Mix have taken to the stage in Manchester now to perform their hit Wings. One of the quartet, Jade Thirlwall, told the crowd: \u201cWe are so, so happy to be part of this incredible day, thank you. The song we have chosen to do for you guys we wrote together a few years ago in the hope it would empower people to stand together and to not let anything bring them down.\u201d A better-known song from Ariana Grande now: Break Free. The crowd is singing along noisily: \u201cThis is the part where I break free...\u201d Just the two songs from the 23-year-old American performer tonight. Ariana Grande opens her set with the track Be Alright \u2013 and some top-notch vogueing from her backing dancers. Ariana Grande is about to take to the stage at the One Love concert in Manchester. \u201cManchester, your bravery is our hope,\u201d says the pop star\u2019s manager, Scooter Braun, introducing her. A small sign of normality returning to the London Bridge area \u2013 Borough underground station is once again open to commuters. London Bridge underground and mainline station remains closed, however, and there is ongoing disruption to Thameslink services and some trains from Victoria as well. A vigil for the victims will be held in Potters Fields Park, Southwark, on Monday night, according to a statement on the London Assembly website. \u201cThe Mayor invites all Londoners \u2013 and everyone visiting our city - to come together in solidarity to remember those who have lost their lives in Saturday\u2019s attack, to express sympathy with their families and loved ones and to show the world that we stand united in the face of those who seek to harm us and our way of life. We will never let these cowards win and we will never be cowed by terrorism.\u201d Members of the public can lay floral tributes at the flagpoles at City Hall. And here are some more lines from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s speech, for the full text released after he spoke. Corbyn criticised President Trump for his comments about the London Bridge attack. (See 12.35pm.) At this time it is more important than ever that we stay united in our communities. It is the strength of our communities that gets us through these awful times as London mayor Sadiq Khan recognised but which the current occupant in the White House has neither the grace nor the sense to grasp. Whether we are Muslim or Christian, black or white, male or female, gay or straight, we are united by our values, by our determination for a better world, and that we can build a better society. Corbyn said that, if he wins the election, he will commission a report on Friday on the changing nature of the terrorist threat. If Labour is elected I will commission a report from the security services on Friday on the changing nature of the terrorist threat. He defended Labour\u2019s plans to raise tax for the rich, saying tax \u201cunderpins our peaceful, tolerant and civilised society\u201d by funding the police. The choice you face on 8 June is a Conservative party which has made clear it will press on with another five years of austerity and cuts to essential public services to pay for even more tax handouts to the richest and the big corporations. Or the Labour party, which is guaranteeing 95% of taxpayers will pay no extra tax but is asking the best off and the largest companies to pay a bit more to fund our hospitals, police, schools, decent pensions and childcare to invest in good jobs and a growing economy for the many not the few. I don\u2019t hesitate to make the case for more tax from those who can afford it. It is taxation that underpins our peaceful, tolerant and civilised society the police, security services, fire and rescue service, our NHS they have all suffered cuts to pay for tax giveaways for the big corporations and the very richest. He said if he won the election he would ensure those who acted bravely in the London Bridge attack are honoured. If I am elected prime minister on 8 June I will be asking the commissioners of the Met police and the British Transport police for the names of those whose bravery should be commended, to acknowledge their heroism and of many others in our emergency services and among the public who intervened. Jeremy Corbyn has delivered his speech. Here are the key points from extracts released under embargo in advance. Corbyn said that he approved of the police using \u201cwhatever force is necessary\u201d to protect life. Our priority must be public safety and I will take whatever action is necessary and effective to protect the security of our people and our country. That includes full authority for the police to use whatever force is necessary to protect and save life as they did last night, as they did in Westminster in March. This is intended to finally quash the confusion created by an interview Corbyn gave to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg in November 2015 when he said he was \u201cnot happy with a shoot-to-kill policy in general\u201d. His comments were taken as meaning that he was not happy about the prospect of the police shooting marauding terrorists killing civilians, but it is more likely that Corbyn thought he was being asked about terrorists being shot rather than apprehended (as \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d operated at one point in Northern Ireland). The BBC Trust upheld a complaint about Kuennsberg\u2019s report, but BBC News said it did not agree with the trust\u2019s finding. Today Corbyn supporters have been protesting angrily about the fact that the original report is currently the fourth most watched video on the BBC news website. He criticised Theresa May for ignoring warnings about the impact of police cuts. You cannot protect the public on the cheap. The police and security services must get the resources they need, not 20,000 police cuts. Theresa May was warned by the Police Federation but she accused them of \u201ccrying wolf\u201d. We will recruit another 10,000 new police officers, including more armed police, as well as 1,000 more security services staff to support our communities and help keep us safe. He said that it would be \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to suspend campaigning any longer or to delay the election. The aim of the terrorists is plainly to derail our democracy and disrupt or even halt this election. The general election is of course about the argument between the Labour and Conservative parties and our very different visions and plans for the future of our country. But it is also now about something even bigger. It is about the struggle between terrorism and democracy itself. The mass murderers who brought terror to our streets in London and Manchester want our election to be halted. They want democracy halted. They want their violence to overwhelm our right to vote in a fair and peaceful election and to go about our lives freely. That is why it would be completely wrong to postpone next Thursday\u2019s vote, or to suspend our campaigning any longer. He criticised the government for refusing to publish a report into the foreign funding of jihadi groups. Britain needed to take a much firmer line with Saudi Arabia over its support of extremists, he said. Our democratic values must be maintained. We must resist Islamophobia and division and turn out on 8 June united in our determination to show our democracy is strong. And, yes, we do need to have some difficult conversations starting with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology. It is no good Theresa May suppressing a report into the foreign funding of extremist groups. We have to get serious about cutting off the funding to these terror networks, including Isis, here and in the Middle East. The reference to \u201cdifficult conversations\u201d is particularly pointed, because May used the phrase herself in her speech this morning. (See 11.56am.) She said tackling extremism would involve \u201csome difficult, and often embarrassing, conversations\u201d. At the Manchester tribute concert, Robbie Williams has taken over from Take That. He changed the lyrics to his song Strong in tribute to victims. \u201cManchester we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re strong,\u201d he sang in chorus with the audience. \u201cWe\u2019re still singing our songs, our songs, our songs.\u201d The Manchester tribute concert has just started. Around 50,000 people are expected at the three-hour concert, which is being broadcast on the BBC. Marcus Mumford from the band Mumford &amp; Sons has opened the show, saying: \u201cLet\u2019s not be afraid.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is due to give a speech in Carlisle shortly. According to a briefing from the party in advance, it is intended to be \u201cstatesmanlike\u201d. He will talk about the London Bridge attack, and about Labour\u2019s values. According to Sky\u2019s Darren McCaffrey, he will also speak about President Trump\u2019s response to the atrocity. (See 3.29pm.) A French man is among those killed in last night\u2019s attack, theforeign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has confirmed, according to French media and Reuters. They report that seven people from France were injured in last night\u2019s attack, four of them critically. One person is still missing. The French government had earlier said four of those injured in the attack were from France. Le Drian tweeted that he would be in London tomorrow. Leaders of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) have backed comments by Theresa May saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d after the London Bridge attack, and said they would be stepping up efforts to curb Islamic extremism in Britain. Muslim community representatives from around the country were led by the MCB secretary-general, Harun Rashid, who condemned Islamic extremism as a \u201cdeath cult\u201d, and said \u201cBritish Muslims must play our part\u201d in turning people away from the ideology. Today\u2019s attack makes us all angry, it makes me angry. And we want to do something about it. That is why we agree with the prime minister that things must change. Enough is enough. We are ready to have those difficult conversations, as equal citizens with an equal stake in this fight. I am pleased that the prime minister is speaking about conversation, it implies that we must listen to one another and work together to be part of a truly United Kingdom. Rashid said the MCB would now initiate a new campaign with mosques to report suspicious activity, and were \u201cextending our hand of partnership and cooperation to the government and prime minister\u201d. We want to turn people\u2019s minds away from this death cult. We want to ensure families are not torn apart by being either victims of terrorist outrages, or finding out that someone they knew perpetrated such acts. One witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, was drinking in the George Inn on Borough High Street when the attack happened. They said: We were enjoying a drink with friends we hadn\u2019t seen in a while in the George, very close to where the atrocious attacks happened. A man, I think the bouncer, came in and shouted at us all to evacuate. There was a moment of silence and stillness as no one knew quite how to react. Our initial reaction was it was a hoax. He then shouted at us to move again and by his reaction, it was clear this was no hoax. We all started leaving the pub, relatively calmly, and then we were told to go back in and started moving back in only to be told to run and get out quickly because there were people with knives and guns. As we went onto Borough High Street, we heard the sound of gunfire and a police officer telling us to run. We all just ran away as quickly as possible. I remember just grabbing my friend\u2019s hand and sprinting away. They said they had no idea what was happening or where they were running to and whether it was safe there. They ended up running into a residential area and then getting taxis further south. I\u2019m still feeling shocked that we were so near and also very lucky. We had nearly decided to go for drinks in Borough Market. My heart goes out to those people who have lost their lives, those who are injured and their families. It could have been us. Holly Jones, a BBC reporter, was one of the first people on the scene to call 999. \u201cThe van was zig-zagging along the pavement and it looked like it was aiming for groups of people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe hit two people in front of me that were about five metres in front, swerved back round again, and just clipped a girl who was walking towards me. Didn\u2019t touch her, and she had headphones in, and I just saw the shock and look on her face as it veered around her. \u201cAt this point is when I saw the driver of the vehicle, definitely intentional, he didn\u2019t look scared he just looked focused. I\u2019d almost like to say the word demented. \u201cThat\u2019s when he was heading straight towards me.\u201d The Cyprus high commissioner, Euripides Evriviades, has ordered flags to be flown at half mast on his embassy\u2019s London building \u201din solidarity with the UK\u201d. The high commissioner, who was among the first to learn that the youngest victim of last month\u2019s Manchester attack was an eight year-old Anglo-Cypriot schoolgirl, said the prime minister\u2019s statement earlier today of \u201cenough is enough is indicative of the direction of travel\u201d. \u201cWhat it said is that all of us are in the same strategic boat,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cEU countries, irrespective of Brexit, have to cooperate closely to defeat this scourge, this threat against our way of life.\u201d What was needed was real-time, day-to-day cooperation at the highest levels, he added. Meanwhile, the National Federation of Cypriots in the UK, which represents 300,000 Cypriots in Britain, expressed its \u201cshock, horror and condemnation of the brutal events in London\u201d. In a letter to Theresa May, the federation also expressed its gratitude to the police and emergency services for the bravery and professionalism they had exhibited. \u201cWe will not allow those who try to divide us and attack our democracy to succeed. Our community stands ready and willing to assist, in any way we can, to defend our common values.\u201d The brother of David Haines, the British aid worker who was murdered by Islamic State in Syria in 2014, has made a plea for unity as the strongest possible response to the \u201cbarbarism\u201d of the London terror attacks. Over the past few years Mike Haines has sought to continue his brother\u2019s work by visiting schools and community groups to combat extremist indoctrination of young people in the UK. He told the Press Association: My deepest sympathies are with the victims and all those affected by last night\u2019s dreadful attack in London. From my own loss, I know first-hand the hurt and anger that many people are feeling today. While it is hard at a time like this, I also know that hate can never be the answer \u2013 that is what the terrorists want, and it is not what we as a country are about. As a nation, our strongest response to this barbarism is to hold steady, confident that terrorism will never break us, as long as we continue to stand together. My colleague, Caroline Bannock, has spoken to Elizabeth, a 22-year-old Malaysian student studying in London, who was in Wagamama restaurant close to the Tate modern on the South Bank when the attack took place. She described the chaos out on the streets when she tried to get home. A waiter said London bridge was closed as there had been an attack. At the time it didn\u2019t feel too close, my friend and I were thinking that the terror had taken place and it wouldn\u2019t be happening again. It was just after 10:00pm and we decided to leave the restaurant. All the doors were locked, which made us a bit scared as we realised that they had been trying to stop people getting in. When we got outside we had a view of 100 people or so all milling around and trying to call cabs. People were standing on corners crying, the fire brigade were there and we started to realise that it wasn\u2019t over, it was still active, we were really terrified then. Elizabeth said they started walking towards Blackfriars Bridge but couldn\u2019t get a taxi. Then people started running behind us, shouting: \u2018They\u2019re stabbing, they\u2019re stabbing.\u2019 Everyone started running and screaming. I held my friend\u2019s hand and we ran for our lives, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve honestly felt this fear, this close, I was crying while running for minutes. When you see everyone else freaking out it\u2019s a horrifying experience. I remember there was a guy on a motorbike on the road and he did a U-turn and in that moment you just don\u2019t know who anybody is, you don\u2019t know what will happen. Finally, she said, two offered them shelter in their flat, which was a few streets away. We stayed there until we could get a cab, which wasn\u2019t till 5am. On Sunday morning the streets were completely empty. I never expected something like that to happen to me, when it happens and it\u2019s so close, it\u2019s hard to get over. The attacks Seven people have been killed in a terrorist attack in London late on Saturday night. Attackers drove a van across London Bridge, deliberately targeting pedestrians, before leaving the vehicle and stabbing passersby in Borough Market. The three suspects \u2013 all male \u2013 were shot dead by armed police, who arrived on the scene eight minutes after the first emergency call was made. Canisters seen around the body of at least one of the suspects have been \u201cestablished to be hoaxes\u201d, police said. At least 48 people were taken to five hospitals across the capital to be treated for their injuries. A total of 36 patients remain in hospital, of whom 21 remain in a critical condition. A member of the public was shot in the crossfire as police officers attempted to neutralise the terrorists. An \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of rounds - around 50 - were fired by eight armed officers to stop the attackers. An officer from the British Transport police was among those seriously injured. He was one of the first officers on the scene and suffered wounds to his face, head and leg. He was armed only with a baton. A Canadian national has been confirmed among the dead. At least two French citizens and one Australian citizen are also among the wounded. The names of those killed \u2013 and the perpetrators \u2013 are not yet known. 12 people have been arrested in Barking, east London. Raids took place at in flats on Kings Road and Barking Road. A crashed van abandoned at the scene on Borough high street appeared to be a B&amp;Q/Hertz hire van. It was hired by one of the attackers recently, officers said. The reaction The prime minister, Theresa May, chaired a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee this morning. After, May warned that there has been \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism\u201d in the UK and, promised to step up the fight against terrorism after the London Bridge attack, saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. Campaigning for Thursday\u2019s general election was suspended. World leaders have expressed condolences, with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, expressing her \u201csadness and dismay\u201d, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying France was \u201cmore than ever\u201d at the side of the UK. But the US president, Donald Trump, faced criticism after using the London attacks to argue for his travel ban and criticising the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. A concert in Manchester on Sunday evening in support of those killed and injured in the attack on that city less than a fortnight ago, is going ahead. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has pictures of what is believed to be a car owned by one of the suspected attackers. Just to be clear - the car was not involved in the attack but is believed to be owned by one of the attackers. David Lammy, the former Labour minister who is seeking re-election as MP for Tottenham, has accused Theresa May of using her speech this morning for campaigning purposes. And Barry Sheerman, who is seeking re-election as Labour MP for Huddersfield, has accused May of allowing police cuts that endangered security when she was home secretary. The mother of one of the victims, 23 year-old Daniel O\u2019Neill, who was stabbed in last night\u2019s attack and is being treated in hospital, has told of her son\u2019s experiences. \u201cHe just stepped outside the bar for a second and a man ran up to him and said: \u2018This is for my family, this is for Islam\u2019, and stuck a knife straight in him. He\u2019s got a seven-inch scar going from his belly round to his back,\u201d Elizabeth O\u2019Neill told reporters outside King\u2019s College hospital. \u201cThe man ran away, Daniel headed back into the pub, there was shots fired, everybody was told to lie down, and then they were told to go downstairs in the bar. At this stage Daniel\u2019s friend had put a tourniquet on him and was holding pressure there, he was brought downstairs, parts of that he doesn\u2019t remember, and then the police were there and brought him in their car to the hospital.\u201d O\u2019Neill said her son was able to talk but remained in shock. \u201c\u201dThese people say they are doing this in the name of God, which is an absolute joke. They are callous, they are barbaric and they are absolute cowards. We will carry on as normal,\u201d she said. As the immediate shock wears off, there are determined efforts in some quarters to express reconciliation and unity. Representatives of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community are speaking to reporters on the cordon, as is the bishop of Southwark \u2013 the attack happened right on the doorstep of Southwark cathedral, which is still sealed off by the police. Meanwhile signs with the hashtag #turntolove have been taped to bollards, alongside bouquets of flowers. Farhad Ahmad, an Ahmadiyya imam, said: \u201cI was completely shocked ... at the same time as an imam that\u2019s read the Holy Qur\u2019an, I felt a responsibility to reach out to people to say, this can\u2019t divide us and that this is not representative of Islam.\u201d He and colleagues came to Southwark because \u201cit\u2019s important that we chat to people because they have questions. We need to answer those questions and reassure people\u201d. The Rt Rev Christopher Chessun, bishop of Southwark, said he had come to be \u201camong my people\u201d and his \u201cheart goes out\u201d to those whose lives were changed by the attacks. \u201cThe faith leaders operate, each of them, within community networks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that all community networks mobilise so that people of goodwill stand together... this must not undermine the things we cherish most.\u201d He added: \u201cThe purpose of our great faiths is justice and peace and human concern for others, especially the vulnerable.\u201d On Borough High St, Alice Cudmore of the Globe Church, a free church in a nearby office building, handed out Heroes chocolates to policemen and passers-by. Asked if the name of the chocolates was deliberate, she said: \u201cThere were Celebrations but we thought that wasn\u2019t quite right. And the police are heroes.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe thought, let\u2019s look after people, help people feel less scared.\u201d The reaction has been \u201cquite mixed\u201d, she said. \u201cI had a long chat with an atheist guy who was quite angry and that\u2019s understandable. Lots of people can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happened.\u201d Police officers have been on the receiving end of other small acts of kindness: the Guardian saw Sainsbury\u2019s staff bringing them snacks and sandwiches, and Cudmore said Costa sent them coffees. \u201cI\u2019ve offered Muslims chocolate and they said: \u2018I\u2019m fasting but I\u2019ll take one for later\u2019,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to chat.\u201d Google has put out a statement following the London Bridge attack saying it is committed to working with the government to ensure terrorists \u201cdo not have a voice online\u201d. This is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. In her speech this morning Theresa May reaffirmed her commitment to getting international agreement on regulating cyberspace to stop the spread of extremism. (See 11.56am.) But the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for internet freedom, has criticised May for wanting to force internet firms to allow access to the encrypted messages of terrorists. In a statement it said: It is disappointing that in the aftermath of this attack, the government\u2019s response appears to focus on the regulation of the internet and encryption. This could be a very risky approach. If successful, Theresa May could push these vile networks into even darker corners of the web, where they will be even harder to observe. But we should not be distracted: the internet and companies like Facebook are not a cause of this hatred and violence, but tools that can be abused. While governments and companies should take sensible measures to stop abuse, attempts to control the internet is not the simple solution that Theresa May is claiming. Some words of support from horror writer Stephen King Mathu, an employee in Sam\u2019s Chicken Shop, said one of the \u201cfive or six\u201d who were taken from the flat was Romanian or eastern European. \u201cHe was about 22 or 23, he was a nice, quiet guy. He lived there with his brother and his girlfriend. They used to come in and order lunch, always ordered wings and chips. \u201cWe suddenly hear something like a gunshot. A man rushed in and told us to stay in the shop. \u201cThe shop was surrounded by police,\u201d she said. Mathu said the two men in the flat were definitely Romanian as they were regular customers and used to josh with him as his girlfriend, Janushan, 15, said there were also four black men who lived in the flat, one of whom he said was Somalian and wore \u201cbrown Islamic dress\u201d. A Romanian chef who reportedly hit an attacker over the head with a crate and sheltered 20 people in his bakery has been hailed a hero. The baker, who works at the Bread Ahead bakery in the market, told the Associated Press: \u201cWe were looking out of the window because we saw that everyone was agitated, everyone was running, people, women ... they were fainting, falling and we went outside to see what was happening.\u201d He said that he \u201cfroze\u201d when he went outside and saw two people stabbing others. However, then he went and hit one of the attackers on the head with a crate. \u201cThere was a car with a loudspeaker saying \u2018go, go\u2019 and they [ the police] threw a grenade .... and then I ran.\u201d He added that he also let 20 people into his bakery with the shutters down. My colleague Denis Campbell has more information on the member of public who suffered gunshot wounds, confirming the man was shot in the head. The man shot in the head during last night\u2019s events around London Bridge is alive, \u201cabsolutely not dying\u201d and expected to make a full recovery, a senior doctor at the Royal London hospital has told the Guardian. Confirmation of the man\u2019s condition came from Dr Malik Ramadhan, the divisional director for trauma at the hospital in east London, where the patient is being treated. \u201cWe had one gunshot wound. There\u2019s a patient in this hospital who\u2019s been shot in the head; a man. He\u2019s absolutely not dying. Our expectation is that he will make a full recovery,\u201d said Ramadhan. The unnamed man is one of 12 people taken to the Royal London with serious injuries, the other 11 of whom sustained injuries from both the van careering across London Bridge and the stabbings that followed. Six of those 12 are receiving critical care. Ramadhan\u2019s statement contradicts reports in other media, at least one of which claimed that the man had died. Rowley said the member of public who was shot by police did not suffer injuries that were \u201ccritical in nature\u201d. As the officers confronted the terrorist, a member of the public also suffered gunshot wounds. Although the injuries are not critical in nature, they are in hospital receiving medical attention and we will of course keep you updated on that. Rowley said the attack started at 9.58pm as the attackers drove a van from north to south over London Bridge. The van mounted the pavement and collided with pedestrians before being abandoned where attackers were armed with knives, continued into the Borough Market area, stabbing numerous people. The attackers were then confronted by the firearms officers and I can confirm eight police firearms officers discharged their weapons. While this will be subject to an investigation by the IPCC, our initial assessment is in the region of 50 rounds, 50 bullets, were fired by those eight officers. The three attackers were shot dead. The situation these officers were confronted with was critical \u2013 a matter of life and death \u2013 three armed men wearing what appeared to be suicide belts. They had already attacked and killed members of the public and had to be stopped immediately. Indeed, I\u2019m not surprised with what they must have feared were three suicide bombers the firearms officers fired an unprecedented number of rounds to be completely confident they had neutralised the threat that those men posed. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has condemned President Trump for his comment about the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. (See 3.29pm.) Farron said: Donald Trump has shown how little he cares for the special relationship and how much he will twist the truth to try and justify his divisive policies. Sadiq Khan has shown calm and dignified resolve in the face of these cowardly terrorist attacks. He is more of a statesman than Donald Trump will ever be. Rowley said the investigation had made good progress but there \u201cremains much more to do\u201d. We\u2019re making significant progress in identifying the three attackers and confirming the fact there were no other suspects at the scene when the attack was carried out. Work is ongoing to understnd more about them, about their connections and whether they were assisted and supported by anyone else. Searches and 12 arrests have been made in east London, he said. There is clearly more to do and we will work relentlessly to get to the facts. We established that the van used in the attack was a white Renault van that was recently hired by one of the attackers. Mark Rowley, Met police assistant commissioner, said a member of the public suffered a gunshot wound as officers attempted to neutralise the terrorists with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of gunfire. The individual is being treated in hospital, Rowley said. Eight armed officers opened fire as they attempted to stop the knife-wielding attackers and discharged around 50 bullets, he said. In addition, detectives have confirmed the white Renault van used by the attackers was hired shortly before the attack. ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday has released the transcript of Robert Peston\u2019s interview with Amber Rudd, the home secretary, this morning. (See 10.53am.) Here are the key points. Rudd explained why the joint terrorism analysis centre (JTAC) had decided not to raise the threat level from severe to critical. The level of severe means an attack is highly likely, and we\u2019ve been at that level for three years. [The level went up to critical after Manchester] because in Manchester we had to be, the police had to be absolutely sure that there was no additional material or explosives out there that could mean there might be a follow up attack. When they became satisfied of that, the independent assessor of the threat level, JTAC, said it was right to come back down to severe. We don\u2019t believe there is additional elements which could be carrying on the attack last night, or JTAC, rather, has made that assessment, so they haven\u2019t recommended going to critical. She said the police were confident the attackers were \u201cradical Islamist terrorists\u201d. She refused to say if the attackers were known to the authorities. She said Theresa May\u2019s reference in her speech (see 11.56am) to \u201ctaking military action to destroy Isis in Iraq and Syria\u201d was not intended to mean she wants more military action. She said the government was working with international allies to get internet companies to do more to tackle extremism. There were two priorities, she said. There is international agreement that we need to get those companies to do more. It\u2019s not good enough just to say, do no harm. We have to get them to actively to work with us to stop their platforms being used to radicalised. It\u2019s two, it\u2019s two points to it. One is to make sure that they do more to take down the material that is radicalising people, and secondly to help work with us to limit the amount of end-to-end encryption that otherwise terrorists can use to plot their devices. She said the government did not want to exploit the attack politically. We are plain vanilla about making sure there\u2019s no political points scoring as we go about trying to keep people safe. Of course it\u2019s right to have a debate about it, but I hope we can do it without introducing politics. Lisa O\u2019Carroll has spoken to a witness to the Barking Road raid The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, issued the following statement after last night\u2019s terrorist attack, confirming a Canadian was killed: Canada strongly condemns the senseless attack that took place last night in London, United Kingdom, which killed and injured many innocent people. I am heartbroken that a Canadian is among those killed. We grieve with the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones, and wish all those injured a speedy and full recovery. Londoners and people across the United Kingdom have always displayed strength and resilience in the face of adversity. We recently witnessed this after the attacks in Manchester and in the Westminster area of London. This time will be no different. These hateful acts do not deter us; they only strengthen our resolve. Canadians stand united with the British people. We will continue to work together with the United Kingdom and all our allies to fight terrorism and bring perpetrators to justice. The government of Canada will not comment further at this time out of respect for the family. All signs are that the police cordon will remain in place overnight, which is likely to cause major disruption if still in place on Monday morning. One police officer said the hope was that the cordon would be lifted by tomorrow morning. Officers have also been advising people allowed into the cordon \u2013 because they live within the area taped off or are staying in hotels there \u2013 to stock up on food to save them having to cross in and out of the cordon again. The Press Association reports a Canadian national was among those killed in the London Bridge terror attack, the country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said. Rashid Rehman, who runs a fish shop nearby who saw the police raid on the flat above Paddy Power, said: \u201cThe swat teams came from the back and the front, there were police with machine guns.\u201d A series of images have come into the Guardian picture desk of a raid at an address in Barking, showing a number of women being led away in handcuffs. Giovanni Sagristani and his friends were in El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street last night when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest. \u201cHe came in shouting and just stabbed her,\u201d Sagristani told the BBC. His partner, Carlos Pintos, who works as a critical care nurse, attended to the woman, with the help of his friend, also a nurse. \u201cThey took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding,\u201d Sagristani said. \u201cShe lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound.\u201d He said fellow diners threw chairs and bottles at the attacker and pushed him out the restaurant. Once he was outside, staff lowered the security gate and locked customers inside. \u201cAfter the initial moment of panic everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant. There were shots going off outside and we didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d It was more than two hours before paramedics were able to attend to the scene. \u201cThey kept her conscious, it was very lucky they were there,\u201d he said. Theresa May made a private visit to King\u2019s College London hospital to hear firsthand accounts from patients and staff on Sunday afternoon. No 10 confirmed that the visit had been made but said no media was invited. My colleague, Lisa O\u2019Carroll, is on location at a raided property in Barking. Our colleague Alan Travis points out that Iain Duncan Smith (see 2.02pm) does not seem aware that the Tpim legislation was updated in 2015 to allow terror suspects to be forced to move home. Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for England, and Sir Bruce Keogh, national medical director for NHS England, said in a joint statement: The appalling events in London last night follow all too fast on the heels of the dreadful attacks we have seen on Westminster Bridge and in Manchester over recent weeks. Our thoughts are with everyone affected. On each occasion we have seen both the worst and the best of humanity. Last night, once again, the NHS and other emergency services reacted swiftly and heroically, going towards the danger to help the injured. Tried and tested emergency plans were activated, with London ambulance service on the scene within six minutes. NHS staff across the capital have also volunteered to work extra shifts and through the night to help the emergency response. As the medical director and chief nurse of the NHS in England we would like to put on record our gratitude and thanks to everyone for their tireless efforts and commitment in what has been a very difficult period. NHS England says that 21 people injured in the London Bridge terror attack are in a critical condition. The BBC has postponed its Question Time special this evening involving Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, and Tim Farron, leader of the Lib Dems, after the London Bridge attacks, the BBC has said. Filmed in Edinburgh, the programme was to have been aired during prime time at 6.05pm this evening following last week\u2019s Question Time special featuring Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. But the BBC has cancelled or postponed all of its set-piece Sunday political programming given the attack on London Bridge on Saturday night. Jonathan Munro, head of newsgathering for BBC News, tweeted: There had been intense talks about rearranging today\u2019s programme with the SNP and Lib Dems but no new date for filming or broadcasting the show has been agreed. Sturgeon\u2019s timetable is now looking extremely tight since she is also due to appear in a Scottish leaders debate on STV on Tuesday evening in Glasgow. She is also still working as first minister of Scotland, while also acting as figure head for her party\u2019s general election campaign. The BBC Question Time webpage has added to confusion about its rescheduling. It says the programme is being aired 10.30pm on Sunday on the BBC Parliament channel and was then being re-shown at midnight tonight on the BBC News Channel and 0.30am on Wednesday. But party sources said this was inaccurate: today\u2019s filming in Edinburgh has been cancelled. Here\u2019s a picture gallery pulling together photos from the events in London. Downing Street has issued a fairly bland statement responding to what President Trump has been saying about Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, over his response to the London Bridge attack. (See 12.35pm.) It is supportive of Khan, but does not criticise the president. This is from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jack Blanchard. A spokesman for Khan himself said the London mayor would not be responding personally to Trump\u2019s \u201cill-informed\u201d remark because he had better things to do. The spokesman said: The mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to coordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city. He has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks urging Londoners not to be alarmed when they saw more police \u2013 including armed officers \u2013 on the streets. Here is the Trump tweet again. It quotes Khan out of context because what Khan actually said was: My message to Londoners and visitors to our great city is to be calm and vigilant. You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. There is no reason to be alarmed by this. Trump\u2019s tweet today may have been partially influenced by his memory of how Khan called the travel ban he proposed on people entering the US from seven Muslim-majority countries \u201cshameful and cruel\u201d. As with the Westminster Bridge and Manchester Arena attacks, praise is coming in for the NHS staff and organisations who helped the injured last night. Prof Karim Brohi, the director of the NHS\u2019s London major trauma system, said there had been a \u201cstrong, standard [and] effective response across [the] London trauma system\u201d from the capital\u2019s hospitals and ambulance services. The system is now \u201cfully operational today. Thank you all. #antifragile\u201d, tweeted Brohi, who is a trauma and vascular surgeon. Dr Paul Clyburn, the president of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland \u2013 some of whose members were called in to help with emergency operations last night \u2013 tweeted: \u201cSad, atrocious, cowardly London attack. Sympathy to victims &amp; families. Tribute to emergency services &amp; colleagues caring for victims.\u201d NHS England is due to issue an update soon about the latest situation with the casualties. Reports are emerging of a heavy police presence and cordons near East Ham town hall on Barking Road. Witnesses reported a police van and four to five police cars arriving at the scene. Police tape has cordoned off the area. The UK will observe a minute\u2019s silence on Tuesday 6 June at 11am in remembrance of those who lost their lives and all others affected by the attacks in London on Saturday night. The silence will be marked at all government buildings and other organisations may follow suit. Flags will remain at half-mast on Whitehall government buildings until Tuesday evening. Salahudee Jayabdeen, 40, said one of the suspected attackers had been forcibly removed from a local mosque called Jabir bin Zayd after questioning the Imam during a service. He said he had seen the man in the area for the past year. It was about two months ago and he started questioning what the imam was saying. I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was about but was asked to leave. He didn\u2019t want to and was forcibly taken out. The owner of a restaurant in Borough Market has told how he and his staff helped take 130 customers to safety in the midst of last night\u2019s attack. Mark Stembridge, owner of Cafe Brood, said he saw three men brandishing weapons coming at pace towards his building. He immediately told his staff, some of whom were ex-military, to pull customers from the open balcony and take them inside. He told HuffpostUK: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what they were screaming but they seemed to hesitate when they saw we were slightly organised. \u201cThen they veered off underneath the bridge towards another establishment called Borough Bistro.\u201d Stembridge has called for more training to be given to restaurant owners in London and said police had passed on advice to him following the Westminster attack in March, and he in turn trained his staff. \u201cHaving had the police down recently when we\u2019ve had a couple of bomb scares, they\u2019ve used some sort of technique of moving and waving their arms, and thats what the boys did, we\u2019ve been told by the police what to do and we secured most of the people within the premises.\u201d Stembridge and his staff were evacuated to the Andaz hotel in Liverpool Street and were released this morning around 6am. Uber has come under fire on social media, with users accusing the company of profiting from last night\u2019s terror attack on London Bridge. Users accused the company of using \u201csurge prices\u201d, which come into operation automatically when demand is high. Some journeys cost as much as twice the normal fare in the hours following the attack, said users, as many frightened people were attempting to get home. Simon Moores accused the company of charging \u00a340 for what he said would usually be a \u00a37 journey from Knightsbridge to Victoria. Uber said fare surges were stopped as soon as it learned about the terror attack. On Twitter the company said: \u201cWe suspended dynamic pricing as soon as we heard about the incident, as we did previously with Westminster and Manchester.\u201d But some users said there had been a long delay of up to two hours before the surge was suspended. Responding to a question from the Guardian, an Uber spokesman said \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d \u2013 which sees Uber prices increase with a surge in demand \u2013 had been suspended at 10.50pm, a few minutes after the company became aware of the incident. Its general manager Tom Elvidge said the company would also refund all fares from around the affected area following the attack. In a statement, Elvidge said: \u201cOur hearts go out to everybody affected by yet another horrific attack on our city. We\u2019d like to thank all the drivers who helped tens of thousands of Londoners get home safely last night. As soon as we heard about the incident we immediately suspended dynamic pricing all around the area of the attacks \u2013 and shortly afterwards across the whole of central London \u2013 just as we did following the attacks in Manchester and Westminster. We are also ensuring all rides from around the affected area were free of charge. Our team is also working with the Metropolitan police to help them get any footage from drivers who were in the area at the time.\u201d The mother of an Australian woman who was injured during the attack has said her daughter is recovering well despite being stabbed in the throat by one of the terrorists. Candice Hedge, 34, from Brisbane, received emergency surgery at St Thomas\u2019s hospital, but \u201cshe is going to be fine, thank goodness\u201d, her mother, Kim del Toro, told Fairfax Media in Australia. She said Hedge had been working at a bar in Borough Market with her boyfriend, named Luke, when \u201che heard some commotion out the front and went out to see what was going on\u201d, del Toro said. \u201cHe saw some men with knives coming toward them, and he ran back inside to see where Candice was.\u201d She said he had been unable to find her, and the police had yelled for everyone to stay down, before he saw her running towards him, holding her bleeding neck. The Brisbane Courier Mail reported that Hedge had finished her waitressing shift at Elliot\u2019s restaurant and was having a drink at the bar when a man came up behind her and slashed her throat from behind with a knife. Del Toro said her daughter had been able to make a Skype call on Sunday morning. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t speak, but I got to see her and she gave me the thumbs up, so I knew that she was OK.\u201d Hedge also posted on Facebook to reassure friends, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She wrote: \u201cI\u2019m doing OK. Still in hospital, but all in the clear. I really can\u2019t talk. The f----- stabbed me in the neck. Don\u2019t worry too much. I love you all.\u201d Dashcam footage from a taxi shows the scene on London Bridge shortly after attack on Saturday night. Casualties can be seen lying on the road and pavement as police rush to attend the scene. Warning: some viewers may find the footage distressing. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said Theresa May\u2019s statement appeared to be a breach of an agreement with Labour to put aside political campaigning and was insensitive to those who are just becoming aware that their loved ones have died. She told Radio 4\u2019s World This Weekend that she regretted the prime minister\u2019s statement because it was not putting forward proposals that are to be implemented immediately. She said: None of the things [May] is proposing in the four-point plan are immediate steps and so I regret the timing of this. There is an agreement between the parties that there will not be party political campaigning until this evening or tomorrow. I think that [what May has said] is drawing us into a debate. I think there is time enough to discuss these issues. I don\u2019t think that anything she is proposing is anything that needs to be or will be dealt with tomorrow, and I don\u2019t think anything is an immediate step that she is putting forward. If it was then, that would be different matter. But to come out on to the steps of 10 Downing Street immediately in the aftermath of a terrible outrage would not be something that would be expected. She has said enough is enough. Well I thought enough was enough after 9/11, I thought that enough was enough after 7/7, I didn\u2019t think we should be taking any more of these attacks on our people, we all agree on that. We need to do more but we also need to be sensitive to the fact that there are people who are only just discovering that their loved ones have died. Asked if Jeremy Corbyn had also made a political point a few hours earlier when raising police numbers and the money required for intelligence, Thornberry replied: I think it is a good idea to stick to the agreement that there was not going to be party political campaigning until this evening and the Labour party will begin campaigning this evening. A man named Will, who didn\u2019t want to give his surname, described how he was among about 100 people to be shut inside the Sheaf pub in the immediate aftermath of the attack. \u201cA lot of people came running in and we thought there was a fight going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bouncer shut the doors and locked us in.\u201d A few others were allowed in to shelter in the pub, he said. \u201cThose guys looked more shaken up,\u201d he said. \u201cA bloke who sounded Italian said he had just witnessed two men stabbing two women repeatedly. He was on the brink of tears.\u201d Then a \u201chuge surge of people\u201d came in, he said. \u201cI think they were from Katzenjammers,\u201d the bar next door where terrified punters had been filmed being ordered to get on the floor by armed police. Will said he believed they came through a shared fire exit or cellar. \u201cThey were all running trying to get out of the building,\u201d he said. \u201cThat caused panic in the Sheaf.\u201d By this point he said there were about 100 people in the pub. \u201cThe Sheaf isn\u2019t really a big pub so it got pretty crowded,\u201d he said. \u201cThe news was just saying it was a truck but we had people in there saying they had seen a stabbing. It was very confusing.\u201d After an hour or so the police told them to leave the area as fast as possible. \u201cWe came across quite a few bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they were dead.\u201d He could recall seeing at least five people on the ground with foil blankets being tended to by emergency teams. \u201cThere was a second surge when we got out of the safe zone,\u201d Will said. \u201cI saw a grown man faint and his friends drag him. That really shook me.\u201d Barking resident Ken Chigbo told Sky News he spoke to the man believed to be one of the attackers only yesterday and he expressed interest in Chigbo\u2019s hire van. I\u2019m moving house at the moment. So I had a big van outside. He came up to me and said \u2018oh Ken, you\u2019re moving\u2019. He\u2019s usually a very nice friendly guy. But this time it was on a different level of nice. It\u2019s quite strange to put into words. He was asking me where I was moving to etc and then he started asking about the van. Where did you get your van Ken? How much is it? Is it possible to get it in automatic? All these specific questions about the van, which obviously now makes sense in my head. At the time, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Southwark Cathedral, which is next to Borough Market, is closed. A statement on its website reads: As a consequence of the terrorist incident yesterday evening on London Bridge and at the Borough Market, Southwark Cathedral remains closed until further notice. This means that no services can take place until the police cordon is lifted. Ajay, from Bombay, India, is on holiday with his wife and two children aged nine and 14. He said his family had abandoned plans to visit Manchester because of the attack on the Ariana Grande concert but we\u2019re staying at the Premier Inn close to where last night\u2019s attack happened. They were in Alma\u2019s pizzeria on Borough High Street, on what was supposed to be the last day of their holiday when panic erupted around them. He said: We were just sitting having a pizza by the window. We saw a lot of police vehicles, we went out to see what was going on and we heard gunshots. At first we thought it was firecrackers, people celebrating the match (the Champions League final) but then we saw people running and ran into our hotel. They were supposed to get a flight back to India this morning but we\u2019re unable to retrieve their luggage from their hotel within the police cordon. We were supposed to go to Manchester then didn\u2019t because of the attack there. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happened in London, it makes me feel numb. I\u2019m from India and you\u2019re used to this type of thing but I thought London was the best, safest place for a holiday. Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former work and pensions secretary, told the World this Weekend that Theresa May would probably try to toughen up Tpims (terrorism prevention and investigation measures). These are the the measures introduced by the coalition to place restrictions on people who are suspected of being terrorists but who have not been convicted of an offence. They replaced control orders, introduced by Labour, which were tougher, but which were being challenged in the courts. Duncan Smith, who served in the coalition cabinet, said that was one of the things to which May was referring when she spoke about toughening anti-terror laws. (See 11.56am.) He was asked if that meant internment and he replied: Internment always conjures up views of internment of the IRA back in the 1970s. I don\u2019t think that is what is on the table. But I think what is on the table is a much tighter view about the way we got about this Tpim stuff. One of the things that I was concerned about in coalition \u2013 I know Theresa May was when she was home secretary \u2013 was during the coalition the Tpim order that we brought in, which gives those powers, was watered down. And I think it was weakened too much. The general sense is, and I think this is the feeling also within the security services, is that, if you think about it, they are watching at least 500 people, every hour of every day. And then there are thousands more that they need to watch, but it\u2019s just not feasible ... So what they need to be able to do is lesson the burden on themselves by, those who they are most concerned about, putting them in a place where they cannot do anything. That allows them to go wider, to investigate and look further ahead at the others. And I think this is really what Theresa May is getting to. There are several differences between Tpims and control orders but a crucial one is that control orders allowed \u201cinvoluntary relocation\u201d. A suspect living in London could be ordered to go and live somewhere else, where he would be out of touch with his associates. Duncan Smith is implying (when he talks about suspects being \u201cput in a place where they cannot do anything\u201d) that May wants to reintroduce this power Duncan Smith suggests May wants to beef up Tpims to allow suspects to be forced to move home. This is from a Commons library note (pdf) explaining the differences between control orders and Tpims. The measures that may be imposed under [Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act] are finite, unlike those under the [Prevention of Terrorism Act], and are less intrusive in certain respects. Involuntary relocation is no longer permitted. This was one of the most controversial aspects of the control order regime, and relocation requirements were struck down by the courts in several cases. Overnight residence requirements which are permitted for Tpim subjects must be based somewhere in which the subject has a residence or connection. Curfews of up to 16 hours are replaced by \u201covernight residence requirements\u201d. The power to confine persons to a particular area is replaced by a power to exclude them from particular specified areas or places. The power to ban all electronic communications is replaced by a provision that requires the subject to be allowed the use of a fixed line and a mobile telephone, and a computer with internet access. Police searches for the purpose of determining whether there is compliance with Tpims now require a warrant from the appropriate judicial authority. Measures to prohibit and vet visitors and meetings are relaxed. The British Transport Police (BTP) officer injured as he confronted terrorists with nothing but his baton is in a stable condition, the force chief said. The BTP chief constable, Paul Crowther, said: \u201cHaving visited the officer in hospital shortly after he was admitted for treatment, I was able to hear his account of what happened last night. \u201cIt became clear that he showed enormous courage in the face of danger, as did many others who were at the scene and rushed to help. Although he is seriously unwell, he was able to recount how he faced the attackers armed only with his baton, outside London Bridge station. \u201cFor an officer who only joined us less than two years ago, the bravery he showed was outstanding and makes me extremely proud. \u201cAll of us at BTP wish him a swift recovery, and I know he will be touched by the hundreds of messages of support from across the UK and the world. Our thoughts are with all of those who died or were injured, and their loved ones as they try to come to terms with what happened.\u201d Members of the public should expect to see extra police officers patrolling stations in London and the south-east. Richard Angell was in the Arabica bar and kitchen in Borough Market when the attack took place last night. This morning he returned to the restaurant, where he was having dinner with friends, to pay his bill and tip the staff. In an interview with the BBC, a defiant Angell said: \u201cIf me having a gin and tonic with my friends, flirting with handsome men, hanging out with brilliant women, is what offends these people so much, I\u2019m going to do it more not less, because that\u2019s what makes London so great, that\u2019s what makes it the best city in the world, and we\u2019re going to go out and enjoy it more.\u201d Angell said he was more determined than ever \u201cto love a city that looks after me\u201d. He said the emergency services were \u201cphenomenal\u201d. \u201cThey were there within seconds, they kept us safe, they swept the place. Two things really stuck with me. One, when we were leaving, the police were our eyes and ears, as we\u2019re trying to avoid blood or people\u2019s shoes that have fallen off or dropped wallets or whatever, they were our eyes and ears. \u201cSecondly I noticed the paramedic who was looking after a woman who was sadly face down on the ground, there was a couple of them, I thought they run at danger, then they turn their back to danger, to put together the life in front of them while we\u2019re running for our lives behind them.\u201d He added: \u201cI might never meet the people who made the judgments that potentially saved my life last night, but I\u2019m thankful to those people. I hope London hugs them in lots of ways.\u201d A taxi driver has told how his passenger saved lives by using her body to barricade a restaurant door in order to stop an attacker from coming in. Aksha Patel said the woman, who was travelling with one other person in his cab, had acted as a barrier for \u201ca few seconds\u201d, allowing people to escape from the back entrance of the Black and Blue restaurant. He told Sky News: \u201cShe knew they were bad people trying to break in.\u201c She managed to hold the door for a few seconds but they overpowered her. \u201cPeople managed to escape through the rear door possibly saving a good 20 people\u2019s lives.\u201d It is just one of a number of extraordinary stories emerging about ordinary people\u2019s acts of heroism, without which the death toll from last night could have been higher. The off-duty Met police officer injured during the attacks tackled one of the terrorists, sources have said. Another two people were injured during the confrontation. Scotland Yard has confirmed that the off-duty officer, as well as a British Transport Police (BTP) officer, were injured in the attack. Officers from the Met\u2019s counter terrorism command have arrested 12 people in Barking in connection with last night\u2019s attacks. In a statement, the Met said: At 22.08hrs on Saturday, 3 June, we received reports that a white van had struck pedestrians on London Bridge. The van then drove to Borough Market where the three men left the vehicle and stabbed a number of people. The suspects were wearing what we now know to be hoax suicide vests. Armed officers confronted the three suspects who were shot and killed in Borough Market. Seven people have died, in addition to the three attackers shot dead by police. A further 48 people were taken to hospital, some of whom are believed to be suffering serious and life-threatening injuries. The MPS is in the process of informing next of kin and specialist officers have been deployed to provide support to families. The Met added that among those injured in the attack are a British Transport Police officer and an off-duty Metropolitan police officer. Both remain in hospital with serious injuries but neither is believed to be in a life-threatening condition. Furqan Navi, who lived in the block raided by police in Barking this morning, said he recognised his neighbour as one of the attackers lying dead in Borough Market after he had been shot by armed police. \u201cHe lived there with his wife and two children, he\u2019d been there for about three years. He seemed pretty friendly but I didn\u2019t know him,\u201d Navi said. Another neighbour said he had seen the man two days ago. \u201cHe seemed a friendly, cool sort of guy. He was friendly and liked playing with kids. He was in his 20s I guess.\u201d Here is the full statement from Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on the London Bridge attack: This is how Theresa May (or whoever writes her tweets) has chosen to summarise the speech she gave earlier: President Trump is still tweeting about the London attack. Bizarrely, he seems to think what happened supports the case against gun control. Here is some reaction to Theresa May\u2019s speech (see 11.56am) from commentators and political figures. From Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader: From Matt Zarb-Cousin, who until recently was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s press officer: From Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former press secetary: From Alex Nunns, the writer and author of a book about Corbyn: From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire: From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush: Lewis Bennett, 39, was a witness to the attack that took place in the Globe pub in London Bridge. His description of events has been contradicted by other witnesses. Bennett described how the attacker, who was between 25 and 30, and clean-shaven, was dressed in a black robe and had a curved knife in his belt, which was about 1ft long. \u201cEveryone gasped when he ran into the pub but he didn\u2019t do anything at first, just stood still for about 10 seconds,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut then he grabbed the knife and stabbed people closest to him. He stabbed people in the stomach and legs, I think about five or six people. People started screaming and running out the back door. He was shouting \u2018Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar\u2019 and he had a British accent. \u201cI went to go stand in the loo and I could hear all the screaming. I came back out and he was standing there right in the centre of the pub and all the blood was dripping from his blade.\u201d Bennett said two policemen then came in through the back door. The attacker lunged at one of the policemen but the other knelt on the floor and fired two shots at the attacker, taking him out instantly. \u201cHe died there on the pub floor,\u201d said Bennett. \u201dThe police came in and covered the body and the paramedics came in to help the people who hadn\u2019t escaped through the back door. I think a few died but most people were still alive I think. It looked like there were about five people who were attacked. It was such a frightening ordeal, it was so frightening.\u201d Bennett told the Guardian he had had a drink at the time of the attack and could not remember every detail. Barking residents have been speaking to my colleagues, Robert Booth and Matthew Taylor, about a raid on a property believed to be linked to one of the London attackers and where as many as five arrests are thought to have been made. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, described the man who lived in a flat at the centre of the raid as a slim, bearded man in his mid-20s, married with a young child, no older than two. He is believed to be of Pakistani origin. She told the Guardian she had recognised her neighbour as the man from a picture that circulated last night of one of the attackers lying on the ground in Borough Market after he had been shot by armed police. Her suspicion appeared to be confirmed when she woke on Sunday morning to see police officers photographing his red Peugeot car. \u201cI realised it was him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is shocking. Everybody here has children and jobs. We never thought anyone here would have the type of mentality to do something like that. I used to see them every night, He had a wife and child and would drop them off home and would look for a parking spot. \u201cHe never used to communicate with the women here. I just knew him as the guy that always came at a certain time and would drop his wife and kid off right close to the main door and then go. \u201cHe never used to park where he should park. He never really looked at us and if he did he didn\u2019t look happy as if he had a why are women out on the street at this time of the night type of look on his face.\u201d She said he wore traditional Islamic robes and his wife wore a full-face veil. \u201cHe used to have the beard, the long dress that men wear, sometimes white, sometimes dark-coloured,\u201d she said. Michael Mimbo, 25, had been getting ready for his shift as a security guard. \u201cI heard cars screeching up the road and lots of shouting of \u2019get down get down\u2019. I went outside to see what was going on and there were armed police everywhere. \u201cThere were three people lying on the floor with guns pointed at them and I saw another one being Tasered as he tried to get away \u2013 it was chaos.\u201d Mimbo said he had seen the man before but did not know him. He said that in all he saw five people \u2013 four men and one woman being detained. Another neighbour, Furqan Navi, 35, said he believed the raid had centred on a ground-floor flat in the Elizabeth Fry block of flats in Barking where a family had lived for at least three years. \u201cThere was lots and lots of shouting so I looked out of the window and there were armed police everywhere \u2013 it was most alarming.\u201d Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has posted a statement about the London Bridge attacks on Facebook. Here\u2019s an extract. Today we collectively resolve to beat the terrorists and their nihilistic creed. To those who sympathise or encourage or harbour or aid or abet these killers \u2013 in any way \u2013 we say enough is enough. Your time is up. The wells of tolerance are running empty. We will not let you disrupt our lives or our democracy. In the week of this general election millions of people need to hear the arguments on either side. They cannot have that fundamental right taken away by terrorists. Millions of Londoners will today get on with their lives. They will go to the pub and to the museums and to the parks and to the shows. The response of the British people will be to carry on with business and usual \u2013 as far as they possibly can \u2013 in a spirit of total defiance. And that is the best response of all. The US president, Donald Trump, has criticised the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in his latest tweet: The chair of the Metropolitan branch of the Police Federation has confirmed Metropolitan police officers are among the injured. Ken Marsh said: I can confirm that sadly some of our colleagues were among the injured in the attack last night. I join all UK police colleagues in wishing them a swift recovery. We are offering them our full support. He added: First and foremost our thoughts are with the families of those who lost loved ones in the horrific events last night and we wish well to those still injured. There can be no doubt that the swift response of our colleagues \u2013 both armed and unarmed \u2013 saved further lives from being lost. There are barely words to describe their bravery \u2013 officers who ran towards danger with no thought for their own safety. Londoners can rightly be proud of their emergency services today. They are the best of the best and we thank everyone for their praise and kind comments. It has been reported that a British Transport Police officer was also among the injured. Theresa May has spoken to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about the London Bridge attack, Patrick Wintour reports. A journalist reported missing in the wake of the London terror attack has been found, a friend said. Geoff Ho, a business editor with the Sunday Express, is in intensive care after allegedly being stabbed. Friends had tweeted that Ho was put in an ambulance after being injured near the Southwark Tavern. The friend, Isabelle Oderberg, tweeted: \u201cWe have found Geoff. He is in intensive care. \u201cThank you for the RTs and messages. I\u2019ll be going offline now until I hear more.\u201d Nora Calder also tweeted: \u201cGeoff Ho, stabbed at Southwark Tavern, taken in Ambulance.\u201d The Sunday Express editor, Martin Townsend, said: \u201cGeoff Ho is an absolutely first-class reporter and a fine and decent man and our thoughts are with him and his family at this time. We are all hoping and praying for a speedy recovery.\u201d The security services and police fear the London Bridge and Borough Market attack may inspire further copycat attacks. The concern is that the Westminster attack in March, the Manchester bombing last month and London Bridge last night will have a galvanising effect on others who had been half-contemplating attacks. The security services will be watching to see what impact the attacks have on the estimated 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, that they monitor and who are regarded as being capable of domestic terrorism. The worry about copycat attacks explains why Theresa May, in her statement outside Downing Street, spoke about \u201cterrorism breeds terrorism\u201d. Since the 2005 London bombing in which 52 were killed, the security services have had a relatively good record. But the tempo has suddenly increased, with three major attacks in just over two months, and several plots disrupted in the same period, one of which has still to be made public. One of the questions the security services will be looking at is whether those involved in the London Bridge and Borough Market attack were inspired by the Westminster and Manchester attacks. Evidence gained from a recent counter-terrorism operation recorded alleged plotters being inspired by the Westminster attack in March to attempt their own atrocity. In her speech on Sunday morning, the prime minister said terrorists were being inspired by copying previous recent attacks against the UK, as officials and ministers searched for answers as to why Britain is facing such an upsurge in jihadi activity in the last 10 weeks. Counter-terrorism investigators believe the upsurge in jihadi attack plots is also possibly linked to the holy month of Ramadan, which began in late May and continues until late June. In 2016, Ramadan saw an upsurge in attacks around the world. This year it has involved an increase in attempts to attack the UK, one source said. Five plots believed to be at an advanced stage were disrupted since the Westminster attack, four in London and one in Birmingham. MI5 currently has 3,000 suspects it is investigating for activity ranging from attack plots to support activities and funding, across 500 investigations. It also has a pool of 20,000 former suspects, among whom for instance was the Manchester arena attacker, Salman Abedi. Police Scotland has warned it will crack down on any incidents of hate crime after last night\u2019s terror attack in London, and said it will \u201cdynamically review\u201d all its security and safety planning, including the deployment of extra armed officers. There was an increase in reported hate crimes in Scotland, chiefly graffiti attacks on mosques and verbal attacks, after the Manchester Arena bomb. Assistant chief constable Steve Johnson said: While we understand that the public will clearly be appalled by these events, I would urge each and every member of our communities to remain united against extremism and hate. Police Scotland will not tolerate any attempts to target any community by any misguided individual or group and will work with all of our partners to resolve any issues and address any concerns. Should anyone become a victim of, or witness to, any hate crime, they should contact the police and report the incident. Johnson added there was no specific intelligence or threat of attack in Scotland, which has an autonomous domestic policing and justice system except for UK-wide intelligence, security and border policing services. The same UK-wide threat level of severe applies too. Police Scotland continues to dynamically review all safety and security plans and operations. An element of this includes ensuring our armed policing and specialist resources are appropriately deployed. The Australian actor who featured in Orange is the New Black, Ruby Rose, was reportedly caught up in the London terror attacks. On Saturday, Rose said on Twitter she was in \u201clockdown\u201d: Rose was with with girlfriend Jessica Origliasso, who is one half of the Australian band The Veronicas. Origliasso also tweeted about her experiences. The Spanish foreign ministry has released a statement condemning the atrocity in London and stressing it solidarity with the UK. \u201cSpain shares the pain of the families of those who have died in these cowardly attacks and wishes all those injured a swift recovery,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government offers the British people and authorities its total solidarity and support in the fight against terrorism.\u201d It added: \u2018The Spanish embassy in the UK and the consulate in London have been following the situation since the start to help Spanish citizens and remain in constant contact with the British authorities.\u201d Another witness to the London Bridge attack has been praised for attempting to fend off the terrorists by running after them and throwing chairs, bottles and pint glasses in a bid to stop them. Gerard Vowles, 47, said he had been watching the Champions League final at the Ship pub in Borough and then decided to go home to get something to eat. He was at the start of the south side of London Bridge when saw a woman being stabbed 10 or 15 times by three men in their 30s. \u201cShe was going, \u2018Help me, help me\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t do nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know if this girl is still alive. I\u2019ve been walking around for an hour and a half crying my eyes out. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Vowles said he followed the attackers to Borough Market and started throwing items at them to try and stop the atrocity. \u201cI know it was a silly thing to do but I was trying to save people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. Vowles said he hit one of the perpetrators on the back with a chair, at which point they chased him to try to stab him. \u201cI knew if I slipped over I\u2019d be a dead man, I\u2019d be killed there and then.\u201d He said it took at least 10 minutes for armed police to reach the scene. \u201cThey literally just started kicking them, punching them, they took out knives. It was a rampage really.\u201d He said he knew the canisters attached to one of the men wasn\u2019t a bomb because he he chased them and thrown bottles at them for five minutes. \u201cIf it was a bomb they would have blown themselves up.\u201d Police vans are arriving at the address in Barking raided earlier this morning. My colleague, Alan Travis, has analysed Theresa May\u2019s four-point plan for tackling extremism in the wake of this latest attack. Theresa May\u2019s \u201ctime to say enough is enough\u201d call to tackle the ideology of Islamist extremism in Britain head-on in the immediate aftermath of the London Bridge attack marks a much tougher response. Outside 10 Downing Street, 12 hours after the London Bridge attacks, she declared that \u201cthere is far too much tolerance of extremism in our country\u201d and said we must \u201cdeny any safe spaces for the extremists\u201d and assert \u201cthe superiority\u201d of British values. The prime minister made no mention of Islamist extremism in her Downing Street statement in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester attack, not even to stress, as prime minsters before had done, that radical Islamist ideology is a perversion of the faith of Islam. This time May has taken a much tougher response both in her language and in the expected policy response, even if the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has yet to publicly comment on the identity of the three attackers. After the 7/7 terror attacks in 2005, Tony Blair announced a 12-point plan for tackling terrorism. It attempted to show the government was serious about toughening anti-terror laws, but Blair was later accused of over-reaction when it became clear that some of his proposals were impossible, or impractical, to implement. Until now Theresa May has adopted a different approach. After the Westminster and Manchester Arena attacks there were no calls for new anti-terror laws. In fact, after Manchester, Amber Rudd, the home secretary, specifically said that the police and the intelligence services were not asking for news powers. Now May has changed tack. \u201cThings cannot continue as they are,\u201d she said in a speech that proposed a new legislative blitz against terror. Here are the key points. May said terror laws needed to be overhauled because Britain faced new types of terror attack. In terms of their planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected but we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threat we face. As terrorism breeds terrorism and perpetrators are inspired to attack, not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots after years of planning and training, and not even as lone attackers radicalised online, but by copying one another and often using the crudest of means of attack. We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are. Things need to change and they need to change in four important ways. May said the government needed to redouble efforts to stop people being being radicalised. First, while the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division and promotes sectarianism. It is an ideology that claims our western values of freedom, democracy and human rights are incompatible with the religion of Islam. It is an ideology that is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth. Defeating this ideology is one of the great challenges of our time, but it cannot be defeated by military intervention alone. It will not be defeated by the maintenance of a permanent defensive counter-terrorism operation, however skillful its leaders and practitioners. It will only be defeated when we turn people\u2019s minds away from this violence and make them understand that our values \u2013 pluralistic British values \u2013 are superior to anything offered by the preachers and supporters of hate. May may have been referring to government plans to reboot the Prevent programme later this year. She said she was committed to working with other governments to get internet companies to do more to tackle extremism online. She said: Second, we cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide. We need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning. And we need to do everything we can at home to reduce the risks of extremism online. This is a reference to an initiative that May was pushing at the G7 summit last month. At the G7 summit, May was focusing on getting internet companies to remove extremism content. In her interview with Peston on Sunday just now, Amber Rudd, the home secretary, signalled that the government would revive its attempt to get internet firms to allow the security services access to encrypted messages. (See 10.57am.) Rudd floated this idea after the Westminster attack, although campaigners and internet companies say her demands are unrealistic and disproportionate. May said there was \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism in our country\u201d and that she wanted to stamp it out. Third, while we need to deprive the extremists of their safe spaces online, we must not forget about the safe spaces that continue to exist in the real world. Yes, that means taking military action to destroy Isis in Iraq and Syria. But it also means taking action here at home. While we have made significant progress in recent years, there is \u2013 to be frank \u2013 far too much tolerance of extremism in our country. So we need to become far more robust in identifying it and stamping it out across the public sector and across society. That will require some difficult, and often embarrassing, conversations. But the whole of our country needs to come together to take on this extremism, and we need to live our lives not in a series of separated, segregated communities, but as one truly United Kingdom. This suggests that May is determined to revive plans for a counter-extremism bill. After the 2015 general election, David Cameron\u2019s government proposed a counter-extremism bill in two successive Queen\u2019s speeches but the law never materialised, reportedly because government lawyers could not come up with a definition of \u201cnon-violent extremism\u201d, which the bill was supposed to target. The Conservative manifesto includes plans to address extremism. It says: To defeat extremism, we need to learn from how civil society and the state took on racism in the twentieth century. We will consider what new criminal offences might need to be created, and what new aggravated offences might need to be established, to defeat the extremists. We will support the public sector and civil society in identifying extremists, countering their messages and promoting pluralistic, British values. And we will establish a Commission for Countering Extremism to identify examples of extremism and expose them, to support the public sector and civil society, and help the government to identify policies to defeat extremism and promote pluralistic values. But the Tories have not said what these new criminal offences might be, or what \u201cexposing\u201d extremism might mean. May\u2019s language this morning is much blunter and more aggressive. She proposed a review of counter-terror laws and floated the prospect of toughening sentences, including for \u201capparently less serious\u201d terror offences. She said: Fourth, we have a robust counter-terrorism strategy, that has proved successful over many years. But as the nature of the threat we face becomes more complex, more fragmented, more hidden, especially online, the strategy needs to keep up. So in light of what we are learning about the changing threat, we need to review Britain\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy to make sure the police and security services have all the powers they need. And if we need to increase the length of custodial sentences for terrorist-related offences \u2013 even apparently less serious offences - that is what we will do. This goes beyond what the Conservatives proposed in their manifesto. She said that since the Westminster attack in March \u201cthe security and intelligence agencies and police have disrupted five credible plots\u201d. A woman from Brisbane is among two Australians injured in the attack, according to the Brisbane Courier Mail. Candice Hedge, 31, was dining in London on Saturday night with her boyfriend when she was stabbed in the neck. She had finished working as waitress at Elliot\u2019s restaurant in London Bridge about 10.30pm and was sitting at the bar having a drink when a man came up behind her and slashed her throat with a knife. It\u2019s understood she had her back to the man and he came up behind her, grabbed her head and slashed her throat. She was briefly in a coma but is now awake and speaking with friends. My colleague, Peter Walker, has filed this take on the response to the attack by the prime minister, Theresa May. Theresa May has warned there has been \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism\u201d in the UK and promised to step up the fight against Islamist terrorism in the wake of the London Bridge attack, saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d. The prime minister struck a sombre and serious tone as she spoke outside No 10 on Sunday morning after chairing a meeting of the Cobra committee following the attack in the centre of the capital that left seven dead. She said internet companies must not allow extremism a place to exist, but that there was also a need to tackle \u201csafe spaces in real world\u201d, which would require \u201cdifficult\u201d conversations. May also suggested the idea of increased prison terms for terrorism offences, even relatively minor ones. Felipe Vaiano, a waiter at Roast restaurant in the former floral hall at Borough Market. He told the Guardian: As we were cleaning stuff two people came into the restaurant crying and panicking, at first we didn\u2019t know what was going on or what to do. Then they tried to talk but they were in such complete panic, they couldn\u2019t really get words out. All they said was there were stabbings downstairs. So we quickly shut all the doors and stayed inside for about an hour. We finally left when the police came up to the restaurant and said \u201cyou need to leave, follow us.\u201d We ran out into the street and it was full of paramedics everywhere. We were then taken to safety through an escape route in the London underground. I think we were taken to Southwark. We ran and I had nothing with me. When we got out I was near the nightclub Pulse and it was there that I was given an Oyster card by the security guard to get me home. When we were trapped in the restaurant, the chef in charge was amazing, he was a voice of calm. He is responsible for the restaurant and panic is contagious so he did a great job of keeping everything under control. He told us to turn everything off, the stoves and ovens etc, which is important as it could be a fire hazard. I finished cleaning up and closing down as we normally do. I was cleaning my section, storing food, putting labels \u2013 I carried on as normal. Obviously it wasn\u2019t a normal situation but I just tried to focus on my job. The customers were in the saloon trying to find out as much news as possible. There was an atmosphere of calm. I was scared when had to run but now sad because of all the people who had been injured and got killed. I am lucky to be alive. The intelligence agencies and police recommended at this morning\u2019s Cobra meeting against raising the threat level from severe to critical, which suggests they believe that there is no one else at large, Guardian security correspondent Ewen MacAskill reports. After the Manchester bomb attack, the threat level was raised to critical, which suggests another attack is imminent because the police and security agencies could not be sure at the time that the bomber Salman Abedi had acted alone. But soon after the threat level was dropped back to severe. The working assumption is that the London Bridge attack was only the three killed by police were involved. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, based at MI5 headquarters in London, is made up of representatives of three intelligence agencies \u2013 MI5, which deals with domestic intelligence, MI6, which deals with overseas intelligence, and the surveillance agency GCHQ \u2013 as well as the police counter-terrorism team and various Whitehall departments. There are five threat levels; low, moderate, substantial, severe \u2013 meaning an an attack is highly likely \u2013 and critical, which means an attack is expected imminently. The threat level was raised to severe in August 2014 in reaction to concerns over Iraq and Syria London\u2019s fire chief said firefighters rushed to shut down gas supplies at premises near the attacks. The London fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, who was at London Fire Brigade headquarters shortly after the incident, said: Our thoughts today are with all of those affected by this horrific terrorist attack in Southwark. Once again I am proud of all of the London Fire Brigade staff involved in the emergency service response. London Fire Brigade officers were deployed to assist police and other emergency service colleagues at London Bridge and Borough Market. Specially trained officers were on site to treat casualties and carried out specific tasks, including shutting down the gas supply in a number of premises to ensure the area was safe. We train alongside our emergency service partners to be ready for this kind of emergency and will continue to remain alert and prepared to respond. At the height of the incident, and in addition to the specially trained officers attending, six fire engines, a command unit and 30 firefighters were positioned at the scene to assist. My colleague Haroon Siddique reports that police officers have stationed themselves outside St Thomas\u2019 hospital. Witness reports of the bravery of Londoners continue to be shared across media. As the attacks unfolded, ordinary people out to enjoy Saturday night or those who were working in the area tried to help victims and fend off the perpetrators. One of them was a taxi driver, who told LBC: I saw the people running away, saw the van went through one of the traffic lights system. If you know London Bridge itself there\u2019s an area called Nancy steps, famous for Oliver, he\u2019d knocked over loads of people down there. Three guys jumped out, of the same description as the guy that took out the Manchester people, similar in looks to him, and they took out these long blades, I\u2019d say about 12 inches-plus long, and just went randomly running along Borough High Street stabbing people. A young girl got stabbed in the chest, laying there, it\u2019s so sad. As soon as I saw this, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m gonna try and hit him, I\u2019m gonna try and knock him down\u2019. I spun the cab round, I was about to ram one of them, but he sidestepped me. These three police officers came running towards him with their batons drawn, they didn\u2019t know what was happening, they just came running towards the incident. Bravery, I wish them all the best, all they had was a baton. The black cab driver, who identified himself only as Chris, described the scene in further detail. It was sickening. I didn\u2019t know what to do. There was two young girls, I picked them up, and just took them away from there, dropped them off as far away as possible. The Home Office has set up a webpage here with information about the support available for people affected by the attacks. The page contains advice on where to seek urgent assistance and information, including the official helplines for the incident. It also provides guidance on support services available for victims, witnesses, family members and all those affected by the attacks. Jo Wace, 64, a teacher from Dartford, and her friend were walking towards London Bridge station as the attack happened. We\u2019d been at the Globe theatre watching a performance of Romeo and Juliet and had been chatting about it afterwards so we were late to leave the theatre. At about 10.20pm, we were walking along the pedestrianised part of the South Bank, we\u2019d just passed the Anchor Bankside pub when we saw a large group of people rushing towards us. We assumed that they had to be running towards something not away from it but then one person told us they thought there had been an incident and then we heard the sirens. The crowd were very calm, very orderly, but then we came across two young French men in their 20s. One of them was very upset and though his friend was trying to calm him down, he couldn\u2019t. I have dual French citizenship and can speak French so I approached him. He was saying: \u201cLook at my hands, I can\u2019t stop them shaking.\u201d He told us he was right there when the van ploughed into people right in front of him. He and his friend turned and ran but they lost another French friend, who was with them, in the confusion. As I was talking to him, we heard a big bang and we realised we should move away. We tried to leave the area together but there were so many people milling around that we lost them. My friend and I spent a long time trying to find an open station; eventually we crossed the Millennium Bridge. There were people taking selfies on the bridge who hadn\u2019t realised what had happened. Just after midnight we caught a train from Liverpool Street to Romford where a friend picked us up and took us back to Dartford. We felt very calm at the time.It doesn\u2019t hit you till afterwards. Reports suggest Southwark Bridge is reopening. Irene Smith, who lives near London Bridge, said she heard gunshots several hours after the area had been cleared. \u201cAt about 1.15am I could hear two gunshots in the distance,\u201d she said. About 45 minutes later she heard \u201canother pop \u2013 it felt like gunshots\u201d, she said. Smith had found her way home after fleeing the area earlier in the evening. She had been on a date in the Slug and Lettuce on Borough High Street when it became clear something was going on outside. \u201cWe were just talking and then suddenly I heard people gather around the window facing Borough High Street,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Somebody said, \u2018Run! Run!\u2019 We thought there was a fight outside so we didn\u2019t bother, but then the staff were shouting, \u2018Leave, run now.\u2019\u201d Police were standing in the middle of the street, she said. \u201cI\u2019m really surprised how quickly police managed to get here \u2013 there was car after car,\u201d she said. Smith remembers a policewoman shouting, \u201cRun as fast as you can. Run for your life.\u201d \u201cSo we didn\u2019t know what we were running from. It was quite unsettling. You half expected gunshots from the back.\u201d She continued: \u201cThe most shocking moment was a woman aged 40-45 in a pink top crying. I hugged her and said are you all right. She said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen someone being stabbed.\u2019\u201d As Smith and her date headed south towards Borough station, police along the way urged the crowd to hurry. \u201cThe police kept saying all the way down ... \u2018Run, keep running, keep moving. Get somewhere safe. Clear the area.\u2019 \u201cPeople were crying, people had lost their friends and couldn\u2019t get in touch with them.\u201d They were told to get on to the tube as soon as possible if they needed to travel. \u201cWe still didn\u2019t know what was happening. We went straight to the tube \u2013 staff were really good, very protective.\u201d A train approached but didn\u2019t stop, and staff said the station would probably close soon. Buses had also stopped, she said. \u201cSo we were kind of stuck in the area ... we wanted to hide somewhere in a small corner or a pub but we thought anyone could storm in and start shooting.\u201d Despite the chaos, Smith remembers feeling oddly calm. \u201cI was laughing \u2013 that was my defensive reaction,\u201d she said. It was only later that the situation sank in. Smith lives in Guinness Court, near Borough Market, and although police told her she wouldn\u2019t be able to get home, she made her way home through the backstreets at about 1am. \u201cIt was pretty empty \u2013 a post-apocalypse feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to see London Bridge so empty on a Saturday night.\u201d Reports suggest a number of people have been taken away by police from the block of flats in Barking. Aerial footage shows an ambulance parked outside the high-rise building, a number of police officers and a tape cordon. Rudd says the government wants to do more to stop the way young men are being \u201cgroomed\u201d into radicalisation. She says the messages of hate have changed. The terrorists are no longer encouraging Britons to join the Caliphate. Instead they are trying to \u201cweaponise\u201d people in this country. Q: We cannot tackle this on our own? Rudd says we can do so much more. The PM has announced an international forum to get internet companies to address radicalisation online. We want them to focus on two things, she says: taking down material that radicalises people online; and stopping people exploiting end-to-end encryption. Q: Is it right to politicise this? Rudd says there will be no politicisation of the effort to keep people safe. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday now. She says the joint terrorism analysis centre (JTAC) has not recommended raising the threat level. It was raised after the Manchester Arena attack because there was a fear that the bomber could have been working with others who might be planning further attacks. But JTAC does not see the need to raise it now. The threat level is still at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. After Manchester it briefly went up to critical, meaning an attack was seen as imminent. Rudd says threat level is not being raised from severe to critical. Sky News is showing live footage of a police operation under way at a block of flats in Barking. The Guardian is yet to verify whether it is connected to the attacks in London Bridge and Borough Market but the Sky News correspondent says it is. May says national campaigning would resume in full on Monday. The election will go ahead as planned on Thursday. We will come together and, united, we will take on our enemies, she says. And that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll post a full summary shortly. May says this is the third terror attack Britain has experienced in three months, after the Westminster and the Manchester Arena attacks. The police have disrupted five credible attacks since the Westminster attack, May says. The prime minister says we are seeing a new style of attack. People are copying each other. Things need to change in four important ways, she says: First, the attackers are bound together by Islamist extremism. It is an ideology that claims our values are incompatible with Islam. Defeating this is one of the great challenges of our time. It will not be defeated by the maintenance of a counter-terrorism operation. It will only be turned around by persuading people are values are better. Second, we cannot give the terrorists safe space. But that is what the internet provides. May proposes to redouble international efforts to control extremism on the internet. Third, there must be action at home. May says there is \u201cfar too much tolerance of extremism in our country\u201d. This will require some embarrassing and difficult conversations, she says. Fourth, we need to review the counter-terrorism strategy, to ensure the police have the powers they need. May proposes to review counter-terrorism laws, and suggests longer sentences for some offences. May says the UK fell victim again to a brutal terrorist attack. Just before 10.10pm last night the police received reports a van had hit pedestrians on London Bridge. It then went to Borough Market, where three men got out and attacked people with knives. They all appeared to be wearing explosive vests. Police arrived within moments and shot and killed the terrorists. The police shot them within eight minutes of the first call being received. Seven people were killed and 48 people are in hospital, many with serious injuries. Theresa May is making her statement outside Number 10 now. Earlier, she chaired a meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee. Arvin Vaziri, 27, a student from Sweden was in A&amp;E at University College Hospital on Saturday night when he heard about the terrorist attack. A few minutes later the first victims began to arrive. We were in one of the cubicles in A&amp;E being seen by a nurse as my wife, Maria Sand had severe stomach pains. At about 1045pm we heard an intercom message on all the speakers saying that there had been a major incident and all available staff had to come and have a meeting. We heard that all the patients who weren\u2019t critical had to be sent home. A nurse came into our cubicle and assured us we weren\u2019t taking up anyone\u2019s space as we needed to be there and could stay. He [the nurse] said that there had been a possible incident and people with gun wounds and stab wounds were on their way to the hospital. We began to hear the ambulance sirens and then people came in on trolleys - there were a few of them, we were told one was a gunshot victim and the others were stabbings. Doctors and nurses continued to check up on my wife and then we were moved from our cubicle as they needed all of them - I think there are about 16 cubicles. It was very professional but very hectic. We talked to one nurse who had finished her shift at 10pm and had arrived home as she lived close-by, however she heard the news and decided to come back in to help her colleagues. Another doctor was off-shift but had biked six miles to get back to the hospital. The staff have been amazing, managing to juggle care of the victims and the patients that already had been admitted. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told ITV\u2019s Peston that the election must go ahead on Thursday. We need to be out there and we need to have the election and it needs to be on Thursday and we need to make sure that people come out defiantly and vote. Because in doing so they are underlining our fundamental values and showing how different we are [to the terrorists]. And earlier she told the BBC. What they are trying to do is separate the very essence of London. We are an example to the world of a multi-racial, multi-national city. We can show the world how it can be. And they just want to undermine it. And we will not let them. We have to make sure that we continue to stick together defiantly and make sure that we work together, again as a community. Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust dealt with nine patients, five of whom have since been discharged. A spokeswoman for the trust said: Following the terror incidents in London Bridge and Borough Market last night, we have treated nine patients at St Thomas\u2019s - six men and three women. Five of the patients have since been discharged and four patients \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 have been admitted. This police officer has posted a poignant message on Twitter: Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has said that the general election must go ahead and that Lib Dem national campaigning will only be suspended for a short time. In a statement, he said: The terrorists kill us because they hate us and what we stand for. They hate our democracy and our freedom. We refuse to let them win. We must respond with a vigorous commitment to our democracy. The election must go ahead as planned. It is right that we suspend our national campaigning for a short while out of respect for those affected by these tragic events, but local campaigning can and must continue. The remainder of this campaign must be a collective showing of defiance and pride in our democratic values. The Ulster Unionist party has announced it is suspending campaigning in Northern Ireland in the general election campaign on Sunday as a mark of respect for the dead and injured of the London Bridge/Borough Market attack. The Democratic Unionist leader and former first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, tweeted this morning: Meanwhile, Ireland\u2019s foreign minister, Charlie Flanagan, said the UK had been \u201csubjected to cowardly and barbaric attacks\u201d. Flanagan said the people of Ireland stand with the UK in this time. Here is some more international reaction to the London Bridge attack. From the Russian president Vladimir Putin From the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi From the Danish prime minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen From Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister From Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs From Antonio Tajini, the European parliament president From Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Sunday condemned the \u201ccruelty and cynicism\u201d of the London attack and called for greater joint efforts in the fight against terror, the Kremlin said. \u201cPutin expresses his profound condolences for the British people and condemns the terrorist attack carried out hours ago in London,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies. \u201cThis crime shocks with its cruelty and cynicism,\u201d the Russian leader was quoted as saying later in a telegram to the British prime minister, Theresa May. \u201cThe Russian president expressed his certainty that the common response to what has happened should be an increase in combined efforts in the fight against the forces of terror around the world,\u201d the Kremlin said. The Russian embassy also confirmed no Russian citizens were among the victims of the attack. Kieran Lovelace was on his way home from work in Liverpool Street and crossed London Bridge moments after the attack. I was strolling home, Snapchatting away. As I\u2019m walking across the bridge I saw (what) I thought was a car accident because I saw a lady talking to the police. I saw an injured couple probably in their mid-30s. Near the edge of the bridge was another injured woman. There was a load of people crowding around her. Everyone was civilians like myself trying to help out. I probably arrived there a minute after it happened. As I was going down the bridge I saw probably six or seven people from one end of the bridge to the other, injured, passed out, covered in blood. \u201cIt was surreal, he said, his eyes welling with tears. Police, armed units and a helicopter arrived rapidly. I saw the armed forces come in. It happened so quickly, I have to give props to the forces because they got there so quickly. The response teams included \u201cunits I\u2019ve never seen before\u201d, he said. I wasn\u2019t aware of the incident in Borough Market, I was only aware of the bridge. People poured out of London Bridge station as it was evacuated and everyone was directed towards Tower Bridge. Nobody knew what was happening: I had to ask people. I just saw all this carnage. He was on the scene for about 15 minutes, he estimated. He described reaching the south end of London Bridge. There\u2019s a statue and there was a lady there with three kids. They were all hiding, she was blocking them. Just to see the terror on their face was a horrible thing to see. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has just told Sky News that the London Bridge attack was \u201cdreadful\u201d and praised the \u201cbrilliant\u201d work of the emergency services. He confirmed Labour was suspending national campaigning for a time, but he said the party would not let this disrupt its campaign for long. We won\u2019t be campaigning nationally during today, but we will resume later on because I think it\u2019s important to give a message that democracy must prevail. If we allow these attacks to disrupt our democratic process, then we all lose. Asked what impact the Manchester and London Bridge attacks would have on the election generally, he said he could not recall any precedent for this in an election. I hope it will not disrupt our process, because we have to have a democratic process. But I also hope we will reflect on the need to have sufficient police officers on our streets, but also sufficient intelligence to look at the terrorist threat. But in response, as in Manchester, all communities must come together. Our strength is the strength of our community unity. That was shown in Manchester straight after the horrible event there and I\u2019m sure it will be the same in London. Asked if the event would be a positive or negative for Labour, in the light of the fact the polls have shown the Tory lead narrowing, Corbyn said he would not comment. At the moment we should mourn those who died and thank those who helped out, he said. A statement from the prime minister in Downing Street is imminent. Simina Motalib lives in Borough Market and was making her way home last night when she was caught up in the panic, as people ran screaming through the street, reports Hannah Ellis-Petersen. She described the scene of carnage outside her door this morning, with the pavement covered in blood and abandoned clothes and shoes. I live literally next to Borough Market. I was coming out of the tube station going home and I just suddenly heard people shouting \u2018run, run\u2019 and then there was this loud scream, it was a young woman, I think. So I just ran. My hands were shaking but I just ran through Borough Market and managed to get inside my house. As I went in I could see people running everywhere, they were crying, there were shoes on the floor. I could see an elderly couple trying to run but they couldn\u2019t keep up with everyone. Neighbours were opening their doors trying to usher people in their houses. It was such a horrible thing to see all that panic. We didn\u2019t know what was going on. I\u2019ve lived here for 28 years and you don\u2019t expect that to happen on your doorstep. The first thing I saw when I opened the door this morning was blood literally everywhere. There were shoes, and clothes scattered and just so much blood on the pavements and on the road. As a British-born Muslim, it\u2019s awful to me to hear them using Islam when they carry out these barbaric acts, particularly in the month of Ramadam. Islam is a religion of peace, so this is so wrong. My colleague Alice Ross is in the London Bridge/Borough area. Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, has refused to suspend Ukip campaigning because he believes that is what terrorists would want. In a statement, he said: With more people murdered on the streets of our capital city last night by Islamist terrorists, it is more important than ever for us to confront this evil with the democratic principles that have made this country what it is. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of those who lost their lives last night. The courage and quick response of our emergency services have yet again saved countless lives and in the midst of such a tragedy, deserve our respect and admiration. It is time to start honouring our dead with more than just words. The only guarantee that will come from our choosing to stall the democratic process again will be more attacks; it is what these cowards want us to do. For those of us seeking to serve the people of this country, it is our duty to drive the dialogue on how best to confront and defeat this brand of terrorism. That is what Ukip will be doing today and beyond. Therefore, I refuse to suspend campaigning because this is precisely what the extremists would want us to do. Asked if she knew the \u201cidentity of the suspects\u201d, Dick replied: \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Dick said the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) would be considering whether to raise the official threat level to its highest \u2013 from severe to critical. The threat level was raised and lowered again in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing. JTAC will be assessing whether the threat level will go up or not. If it were to go up or if we felt there was a particular need for military support we absolutely would ask for it. Dick said she was working on assumption that the Met would be sharing intelligence with the US authorities. My working assumption is we will of course be sharing information appropriately with our American colleagues,\u201d she said. This comes after US officials leaked intimate details of the Manchester Arena investigation to US press. Addressing resources at the Met, she said: We have very good resources, we have extraordinarily trained people. We have excellent working relationship with our colleagues in the agencies. These sorts of things are hard to predict and sometimes sadly as has been proven in the recent weeks are hard to prevent. In light of Westminster, Manchester, we will look at our resource levels and how we use them. Scotland\u2019s political parties have also suspended national campaigning today, with Scottish Labour\u2019s leader Kezia Dugdale cancelling her event in their target seat of East Lothian and Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, cancelling his in their target seat of East Dunbartonshire. The Scottish National party said \u201cappropriate\u201d local campaigning would continue but events with Nicola Sturgeon would not, although that would be reviewed during the day. \u201cOur thoughts are with those affected by the frightening events in London,\u201d a spokesman said. Respect for those who lost their lives must be our priority. However it is also important, especially so close to an election, that the terrorists do not succeed in their attempts to undermine our democracy. Dugdale said: My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families after the horrific terrorist attacks in London last night. Once again our nation finds itself under attack from those who hate our way of life and seek to change us. But we will not allow that to happen, because the values that they hate - democracy, the rule of law and tolerance - are what make our country so special. It\u2019s why Britain is a beacon for other nations around the world. We will not let the terrorists win. In England the Green party has said it will suspend national campaigning until this evening. But local campaigning will continue. Jonathan Bartley, the party\u2019s co-leader, said: As in Manchester, and in the aftermath of the Westminster attacks, people will come together in the coming days and demonstrate that our way of life is precious and will not be surrendered to those determined to spread fear. In Wales the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said: This is another devastating attack. Plaid Cymru extends its condolences to the people affected and the emergency services that work so hard in these difficult circumstances. People deserve to live their lives without fear, and we must come together to reject hate. Dick paid tribute to the police, emergency services and members of the public who came to the aid of the injured \u2013 and confronted the attackers. She said: In the early hours of this morning I visited one of the hospitals in London. There, I heard truly remarkable stories and extraordinarily brave actions by officers on and off duty first on the scene. I heard of colleagues of other emergency services and members of the public who ran towards the danger as the incident unfolded. Many, many people risked their own safety to help others and treat those seriously injured and indeed to confront suspects involved. The courage of those people during and following the attack was extraordinary and I pay tribute to all of them ... I\u2019m sure they helped to save lives. Dick says the incident is under control but police officers need to conduct thorough search of the area to make sure all are accounted for. The cordon will remain, she says. I appreciate this has been a terrifying experience for many people. Cressida Dick, the Met police commissioner, has said seven members of public have died in the attack, at least 48 are injured. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has just told BBC News it would be wrong to postpone the general election. That is not what the public would want, he said. And, even if it was desirable, he said he was \u201cnot sure that it can be legally done\u201d. Davis said he did not know whether the attack was intended to disrupt the election. If it was, that was all the more reason not to postpone it, he said. I think we are locked into [June 8]. I think, actually, the public would want us to be locked in. There is a balance of things here. Clearly we want to respect the people who have been injured and killed, we want to pay proper respect, therefore we don\u2019t want to carry on across it. But on the other hand the people doing this are doing it because they despise the freedoms we have, and those freedoms can be the freedom to go out on a Saturday night, or the freedom to cast a vote. And it may be - we don\u2019t know, at least I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not briefed this morning on this - I don\u2019t know whether or not they are deliberately trying to disrupt the general election, or whether this is a coincidence of timing ... in which case, all the more reason not to defer, not to deflect, to as far as possible, within the grounds of propriety, to actually not let this put us off course. Citing Spain and the Madrid bombing as an example, he said other European countries have gone ahead with elections shortly after a terrorist attack. Greater Manchester police confirm the One Manchester concert and Michael Carrick testimonial match are to go ahead. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan from Greater Manchester police said: We\u2019re deeply saddened to hear about last night\u2019s horrific attacks in London and our thoughts are with everyone affected, including the emergency services responding to the incident. There are two large-scale events taking place in Greater Manchester today and we would like to assure people that these will still take place, but with additional security in place to ensure the safety of everyone. We have dedicated resources at both events, with a significant number of officers from both GMP and colleagues from other forces, some of which will be armed. There will be additional security checks taking place and everyone will be searched, including bags. We would ask people not to bring bags if they can, as this will help speed up entry. I\u2019d like to remind people that the threat level remains at severe, which means an attack is highly likely. Please remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious that causes you concern to the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321 or 999 in an emergency. Borough High Street is still sealed off a couple of hundred metres from the market, with an unsurprisingly heavy police presence on the cordon, watched by a clutch of TV crews, Alice Ross reports. A single bunch of sunflowers lay on a traffic island. Antonio Gonzalez, an assistant manager at the St Christopher\u2019s Inn, just inside the cordon, said: \u201cI saw so many police cars going that way so I went to check Borough Market.\u201d As he reached Starbucks, he saw the police firing. \u201cIt was really fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see it that clearly but apparently there were two to three terrorists and they started shooting at them. I came back to the hostel to take everyone out.\u201d The hostel\u2019s 52 guests, all of whom are safe and well, were evacuated to a sister hostel. Gonzalez, with other hostel staff, was overseeing guests as they returned in small groups to collect their belongings. He was dazed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night, he said. Yu An Lee, a hostel guest from Korea, was shivering in shorts and a T-shirt in the early morning as he waited to be allowed in. His mother, in a light T-shirt and sandals, wrapped her arms around him as they waited. They had arrived from Italy and checked in at about 10pm. \u201cWe heard a big sound, like people shouting to each other. We thought someone was fighting or having an argument \u2013 it was very loud,\u201d he said. \u201cFive minutes later the staff came to the building and told us to stay in the building because it was very dangerous. The staff said she didn\u2019t know what was going on. There was panic.\u201d Two or three minutes later the police came to the first floor and ordered people to leave as soon as possible. Officers on the street ordered people to run south. \u201cMe and my mum started to run as fast as we can ... everyone was really terrified,\u201d he said. In the commotion, Lee couldn\u2019t see what was happening behind them. \u201cAll we thought about was running away. Lots of people were running together. We tried to stay in a group.\u201d They didn\u2019t stop until they reached Elephant and Castle, 15-20 minutes away. \u201cThis area was really in a panic,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we got further away from the scene people seemed to be normal, just smoking, riding on the bus. It seems some people didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d For Lee and his mother, newly arrived in an unfamiliar city, the contrast was stark. \u201cWe were terrified and horrified. All we could think about was running away and trying not to get separated.We really didn\u2019t have any idea what was going on ... nobody explained to us what was going on.\u201d They were taken to a hostel in Camden, where staff tried to make them comfortable in communal areas. Learning the incident was a suspected terror attack made him \u201cmore terrified,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night I thought something was going terribly. But I just read the news this morning and actually there was terror.\u201d This was \u201cespecially horrifying\u201d, he said. Jean-Yves Le Drian, France\u2019s foreign minister, has said there are four French victims injured in the London Bridge attack, one of them seriously. In a tweet posted in the early hours of Sunday, the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said he was monitoring the attacks with worry and sadness, adding: \u201cOur solidarity and support to the authorities and to the British people.\u201d The country\u2019s foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, tweeted: \u201cMy condolences on a tragic night. We stand with the victims and their families.\u201d The Spanish consulate in London tweeted emergency phone numbers for those concerned about friends and relatives in London who may have been caught up in the attack. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said earlier the general election should not be postponed. \u201cThey want to stop us voting on Thursday in the general election \u2026 we can\u2019t allow them to do that,\u201d he said. (See 7.22am.) In practice, postponing the general election is not a realistic possibility, because it would be extremely difficult. Many people have already cast postal ballots. David Boothroyd, a parliamentary expert, reckons the government would have to declare a state of emergency for this to happen. There is provision in the Representation of the People Act for a general election to be delayed for a fortnight \u2013 but that only applies in the event of the monarch dying between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. In 2001, Tony Blair did \u201cdelay\u201d the general election for a month because of the foot and mouth outbreak. It was expected in May, but took place in June. But Blair had never actually announced that the general election would be in May \u2013 it was just widely assumed it would coincide with the local elections, which were formally delayed \u2013 and so the comparison is not really relevant. A man from New Zealand has been put in an induced coma after being seriously injured in the attacks, New Zealand media report. Oliver Dowling, from Christchurch, was among those injured in the Borough Market stabbing, according to his family. His sister, Freddy, says he\u2019s in an induced coma after being stabbed in the face, neck and stomach. The injuries missed his vital organs, she says. The BBC has spoken to witnesses who heard one of the attackers shout \u201cthis is for Allah\u201d before stabbing a woman several times. Alex was in the Mudlark pub, close to Southwark Cathedral. A woman probably in her early 20s staggered into the pub and she was bleeding heavily from the neck and from her mouth. It appeared to myself and to my friends that her throat had been cut. People went to her aid. The pub was then closed. We saw police on the roads nearby. As we were told to leave the area by armed police, as we were running away from there, I could see to my left there was a further individual having CPR performed on them by the emergency services. Another witness, Eric, said: Three men jumped out of the van and that\u2019s when they started attacking people on the road. As they headed down the stairs, as they were running towards the people they were shouting this is for Allah. Mark told the BBC he was taking photographs on London Bridge when he saw the van hitting pedestrians on the bridge. It was swerving from side to side and I could see it hitting people and there was a group about 20 or 30 yards in front of me. The van hit those people. At that moment I was doing that calculation of trying to work out which direction should I run. Ben was outside Borough tube station. He said: I saw a man in red with quite a large blade. I am guessing 10 inches. He was stabbing a man, maybe three times, fairly calmly. It looked like the man maybe had been trying to intervene but there wasn\u2019t much he could do. He was stabbed quite coldly and slumped to the ground. Gerard was in the Borough Market area as the three attackers ran through attacking people in with knives in two pubs and a restaurant. He said he was threatened, but fought them. I threw something at them, maybe like a stool, a chair, and as I threw it at them it him one of them, maybe two of them on the head here, on the back. Then they ran towards me to try and stab me so I ran away because I knew if I would have slipped over I would be a dead man, I\u2019d be dead, I\u2019d have been killed there and then. The leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, has confirmed national campaigning has been suspended. He said: We are all shocked and horrified by the brutal attacks in London. My thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have died and the many who have been injured. Today, we will all grieve for their loss. I would like to thank the police and emergency services for their bravery and professionalism in acting to save lives and deal with these appalling acts of terrorism, as well as NHS staff and members of the public who sought to protect others. The Labour party will be suspending national campaigning until this evening, after consultations with other parties, as a mark of respect for those who have died and suffered injury. Those who wish to harm our people, divide our communities and attack our democracy will not succeed. We will stand together to defend our common values of solidarity, humanity and justice, and will not allow terrorists to derail our democratic process. Hi, Jamie Grierson here, taking over live coverage of the horrific terror attacks in London last night at London Bridge and Borough Market. The attacks Six people have been killed in a terrorist attack in London late on Saturday night. Attackers drove a van across London Bridge, deliberately targeting pedestrians, before leaving the vehicle and stabbing passersby in Borough Market. The three suspects \u2013 all male \u2013 were shot dead by armed police, who arrived on the scene eight minutes after the first emergency call was made. Canisters seen around the body of at least one of the suspects have been \u201cestablished to be hoaxes\u201d, police said. At least 48 people have been taken to five hospitals across the capital to be treated for their injuries. Some are in a serious condition. Other walking wounded were treated at the scene or at a rescue centre set up in a hotel at Liverpool Street. An officer from the British Transport police was among those seriously injured. He was one of the first officers on the scene and suffered wounds to his face, head and leg. At least two French citizens and one Australian citizen are also among the wounded. The names of those killed \u2013 and the perpetrators \u2013 are not yet known. No related arrests have been reported, and police say they believe the three men shot dead were the people directly responsible for the attack. The investigation into a possible wider network continues. A crashed van abandoned at the scene on Borough high street appeared to be a B&amp;Q/Hertz hire van. A stabbing in Vauxhall on Saturday night was not connected to the terror attacks, police confirmed. The reaction The prime minister, Theresa May, is chairing a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee this morning. London mayor Sadiq Khan will attend. Campaigning for Thursday\u2019s general election has been suspended, with the Conservatives and the SNP saying they would not campaign today, and other major parties expected to follow suit. World leaders have expressed condolences, with German chancellor Angela Merkel expressing her \u201csadness and dismay\u201d and French president Emmanuel Macron saying France was \u201cmore than ever\u201d at the side of the UK. But US president Donald Trump faced criticism after using the London attacks to argue for his travel ban. A concert in Manchester on Sunday evening in support of those killed and injured in the attack on that city less than a fortnight ago, will go ahead, organisers say. Ariana Grande, whose concert at Manchester Arena was targeted and who will perform this evening, tweeted her support for those affected by the London attack: The Scottish National party will also suspend campaigning for the general election today. Party leader and Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would chair a meeting of the devolved government\u2019s resilience committee to discuss the attack. Sturgeon said: Following the horrific terrorist attack in the centre of London last night, we are working closely with the UK government and Police Scotland to monitor the situation \u2026 My thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have tragically lost their lives and with everyone who has been harmed or affected by these terrible incidents. The meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee is beginning shortly; ministers are arriving at Downing Street. London mayor Sadiq Khan will also attend. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has expressed her \u201csadness and dismay\u201d at news of the attack: Today, we are united beyond all borders in horror and sorrow, but also in determination. In the fight against every form of terrorism, we stand firmly and with determination at Britain\u2019s side. At least 48 injured people were taken to hospitals across the capital after the attack. Fourteen of them \u2013 six women and eight men \u2013 were taken to King\u2019s College hospital, in Denmark Hill, south London. A spokesman for the hospital said this morning: The emergency department at King\u2019s College hospital received 14 casualties (six females and eight males) following the incidents at London Bridge and Borough Market in central London. One patient has been discharged. The BBC has spoken to several eyewitnesses who have given accounts of several stages of the attack. Mark told the BBC he was taking photographs on London Bridge when he saw the van hitting pedestrians on the bridge: It was swerving from side to side and I could see it hitting people and there was a group about 20 or 30 yards in front of me. The van hit those people. At that moment I was doing that calculation of trying to work out which direction should I run. Ben was outside Borough tube station: I saw a man in red with quite a large blade. I am guessing 10 inches. He was stabbing a man, maybe three times, fairly calmly.

Gerard was in the Borough Market area as the three attackers ran through attacking people in with knives in two pubs and a restaurant. He said he was threatened, but fought back: I threw something at them, maybe like a stool, a chair, and as I threw it at them it him one of them, maybe two of them on the head here, on the back. Then they ran towards me to try and stab me so I ran away because I knew if I would have slipped over I would be a dead man, I\u2019d be dead, I\u2019d have been killed there and then.

As we were told to leave the area by armed police, as we were running away from there, I could see to my left there was a further individual having CPR performed on them by the emergency services. Following French media reports that at least two French citizens were injured in the attack, here is the statement from the president\u2019s office: The statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e said: The attack which struck London, days after that which took place in Manchester, is a new abominable and cowardly attack against our free society. Fellow French citizens are among the injured. France is putting everything in place to assist them. The Conservatives have suspended national election campaigning after the terrorist attack on London Bridge in which at least six people were killed and the three attackers shot dead by police. While local work such as leafleting would go on, the party said it had decided to not campaign nationally on Sunday, with the suspension to be reviewed over the day, and as more details emerge of the attack and its aftermath. Other parties had yet to comment, but it appeared likely both Labour and the Liberal Democrats would follow suit, with the election just four days away. It is the second terrorism-related suspension of the campaign \u2013 it stopped for three days after last month\u2019s suicide bomb attack in Manchester, which killed 22 people. My colleague Hannah Ellis-Petersen is in Borough this morning: Dozens of people who live in the Borough market area or were staying at hotels nearby have spent the night sleeping in the lobby of the Hilton London Bridge, huddled under duvets on chairs and makeshift beds made from sofas and benches. Ian, who lives on the riverfront near Borough market and has not been allowed back to his flat, said he had been eating at Fish restaurant on the other side of Borough market from the attack when at around 10.15pm they noticed people running past the window screaming. \u201cWe started to notice people running past rather frantically, but we didn\u2019t think too much about it initially because it\u2019s Saturday night,\u201d he said. \u201cBut suddenly we noticed the manager telling people to come inside, so I realised something was wrong. They brought us all into the restaurant kitchen where there were no windows, because the whole restaurant is glass. \u201cThen around 11am, the police came storming in and said \u2018follow us with your hands on your head\u2019 and they walked us all to a safe position the other side of London bridge. There were policemen with guns lining the whole area where we walked but we didn\u2019t really have time to notice anything around. \u201cThere was complete panic but I must say the police handled it very professionally.\u201d Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says one Australian has been injured, and officials are looking into reports a second was also caught up in the attack: One case has been confirmed and the Australian concerned is in hospital. In the other case, we are continuing to make inquiries. Our officials will continue to provide every assistance they can to Australians affected by this shocking attack and their families. A man reported missing by friends overnight has been located in hospital, where he is intensive care, Press Association reports: Geoff Ho, a business editor with the Sunday Express, is in intensive care after allegedly being stabbed. Friends had tweeted that Ho was put in an ambulance after being injured near the Southwark Tavern. His friend Isabelle Oderberg tweeted: \u201cWe have found Geoff. He is in intensive care. \u201cThank you for the RTs and messages. I\u2019ll be going offline now until I hear more.\u201d The Metropolitan Police has a casualty bureau for anyone concerned about friends or relatives. There are two numbers to call: 0800 096 1233 020 7158 0197 My colleague Alice Ross is at the Andaz hotel in Liverpool Street, which was used overnight as a rescue centre for less seriously injured victims of the attack: Arthur Ventura, from Birmingham, was staying at the Andaz hotel, where the walking wounded were taken. He was meeting a friend at about 11pm when he saw people arriving. \u201cI saw a few victims or casualties that were taken here to the hotel,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the casualties were taken to the first floor to be treated.\u201d Ventura saw about four casualties, including a man with a head wound and another who was unable to walk properly. \u201cThere were no paramedics [at that time]: it was all staff helping people,\u201d he said. Staff were calm and helpful, giving out bottles of water and giving first aid to the wounded. \u201cThey weren\u2019t panicking.\u201d Ventura went out for the evening. When he returned to the hotel at 5am security was tight. \u201cThere were still police and hotel staff were asking for ID,\u201d he said. He was smoking outside, unable to sleep. Three armed police at the hotel doors left at around 7am and a member of hotel staff said nobody involved in the incident was still at the hotel. At least two French citizens have been injured, one seriously, Reuters reports, citing the French president\u2019s office. Khan confirms he will be attending the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee meeting this morning. He says, although campaigning is suspended today, Thursday\u2019s general election should go ahead: They [the terrorists] want to stop us enjoying the freedoms that we have \u2026 they want to stop us voting on Thursday in the general election \u2026 we can\u2019t allow them to do that. I\u2019m not an advocate of postponing the election, I\u2019m a passionate believer in democracy \u2026 One of the things these terrorists hate is democracy. People should remain calm and vigilant, carry about their normal business. But he adds: The threat level remains severe \u2026 [that] means an attack across the country is still highly likely. Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the next few days \u2026 some of it armed officers. But Khan says London is one of the safest global cities in the world. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has been speaking about last night\u2019s attack. He says he is \u201cappalled and furious that these cowardly terrorists would deliberately target innocent Londoners\u201d. There can be no justification \u2026 Six people have been killed, more than 40 have been injured \u2013 some of them, I\u2019m afraid are critical. Khan says the emergency services \u201creacted heroically\u201d: As a result of their swift action, fewer people have died than would otherwise have been the case. Other major parties are also expected not to campaign today. The Conservative party has just issued this statement: The Conservative party will not be campaigning nationally today. We will review as the day goes on and as more details of the attack emerge. Images from the scene this morning show the crashed van driven by the suspects across London Bridge: The van appears to be an hourly hire Hertz vehicle, rented via a B&amp;Q DIY store, as the image from the rental website shows: Robert Peston, ITV\u2019s political editor, reports that national campaigning for Thursday\u2019s general election has been suspended: Local campaigning \u2013 door-knocking and leaflet dropping \u2013 will continue, Peston reports. After the attack on Manchester Arena, the major parties suspended national campaigning for three days. Overnight, my colleague Carmen Fishwick was at Liverpool Street, outside the Andaz hotel, which is being used as an official rescue centre. She reported that there were four ambulances, an ambulance control unit and at least 30 emergency service workers and armed guards on the scene, with at least two people being treated: one with a head injury and a woman in a wheelchair: I spoke to a man who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the attack, whose car has been impounded by police. A 25-year-old man, who wishes to remain anonymous, was driving across the bridge when he saw a man and a pregnant woman unconscious on the road. He says they were there for at least five minutes before the emergency services arrived. \u201cWe thought it was a car accident but as we got closer we could see a lot of blood and bodies. There was a pregnant woman on the right who was severely injured and on the left there was a man being resuscitated, but he started breathing. We don\u2019t know whether the woman survived. \u201cWe had to get out of the car and there were lots of people screaming. And then ambulances arrived. It was a shocking experience.\u201d Saturday night\u2019s terrorist incidents in London prompted the first use of a new police warning to the public, to \u201crun, hide, tell\u201d in the event of an attack. As the incident was underway, the London Metropolitan police issued an alert through social media channels, warning people in the area to run away from any threat, rather than surrender or attempt to negotiate. If that wasn\u2019t possible, they should instead hide, turn their phone to silent and barricade themselves in before calling police. Many people out in London did not get the chance. Others, according to reports, instead took on the attackers head-on in an attempt to rescue victims, fighting back with chairs and pint glasses. In an information video about the new campaign, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said the instructions were based on proven advice. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware of the terrorism challenges across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can never cater for every possible eventuality and, if someone acts on instinct and perhaps decides to fight because they have no choice, we would never criticise them for that.\u201d Initial police reports said at least 20 people had been taken to hospitals across the capital. That number has now risen to 48. Other \u201cwalking wounded\u201d were treated at the scene. An ambulance crew arrived at the scene six minutes after the first emergency call. Here is the statement from London Ambulance Service assistant director of operations, Peter Rhodes: Our thoughts are with all of those affected by the incident at London Bridge and their friends and family. We took 48 patients to five hospitals across London and treated a number of others at the scene for minor injuries. Police have confirmed that sadly, six people also died at the scene. We were called to the incident at 10.07pm (Saturday 3 June), with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. We sent over 80 of our medics to the scene including ambulance crews, advanced paramedics, specialist response teams and an advanced trauma team from London\u2019s Air Ambulance. We declared a major incident and worked closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene. Our priority was to assess patients and ensure that they were treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. London Ambulance Service confirms it has taken 48 people to five hospitals across London. It says that is in addition to the six people who died at the scene. The three suspects were also shot dead by police at the scene. With three suspects shot dead by police, investigators will be trying to establish quickly whether a wider network was involved. Met police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said that officers believed all the attackers directly involved in the attack had been killed: We believe three people were involved, but we still have got some more inquiries to do to be 100% confident in that. Bethany Atkin, who works for the Guardian, was at Boro Bistro, a restaurant that sits under an overpass on Borough High Street, close to where the van driven by the attackers crashed: We were sitting outside under umbrellas underneath the bridge and there was a shower of rubble that landed on the umbrellas. A van had crashed into the bridge. We stood up, everyone was moving, I saw a man who was bleeding. I don\u2019t know how he was injured. We ran into the restaurant and tried to find a safe place, but there wasn\u2019t one. Running back outside, Atkin saw another casualty: We saw a woman with blood, about 20 metres from the bridge. I saw her lying down on the floor. Atkin ran into London Bridge hospital to shelter but there was another commotion on the street: A man was shouting and then everyone started screaming and running away from the man. It was very sinister. The prime minister, Theresa May, was among political leaders expressing their thanks to emergency services for their response to the terror attack. May has broken off from campaigning for Thursday\u2019s general election, and will chair an emergency meeting of the government\u2019s crisis committee, Cobra, on Sunday morning. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will also attend. Six people have been killed in terror attacks on London Bridge and at Borough Market. Attackers drove a van across London Bridge, targeting pedestrians, before leaving the vehicle and stabbing passersby. Three male suspects have been shot dead by police. Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said the men were dead eight minutes after the first emergency call was received. Canisters seen around the body of at least one of the suspects have been \u201cestablished to be hoaxes\u201d, police said. At least 30 people injured in the attacks have been taken to five hospitals across London. Others were treated at the scene. One of those injured was a British Transport police officer who was one of the first on the scene in response to calls from help from the public. He was stabbed in the head, face and leg, but his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. None of those killed or injured, or the perpetrators, have yet been named. Police believe all of those directly responsible for the attack have been killed. Investigations are ongoing. A stabbing in Vauxhall on Saturday night was not connected to the London Bridge attacks, police confirmed. This image shows the journey taken by the van \u2013 north to south across London Bridge, before crashing in front of the Barrowboy and Banker pub at the top of Borough High Street. Police said the assailants then left the vehicle and ran through Borough Market, stabbing people in bars and restaurants. The crashed van apparently used by the three terror suspects can be seen this morning in front of the Barrow Boy and Banker pub, opposite London Bridge station: The attackers were shot by police from an armed response vehicle, which patrol around Britain ferrying armed officers to incidents. The numbers of ARVs were increased across Britain were increased after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. British police remain largely unarmed, unlike most of their counterparts across the world. Peter Rhodes, the London Ambulance Service assistant director of operations, has given more information on the emergency response to the attacks: We have now taken over 30 patients to five hospitals across London following the incident at London Bridge. A number of other patients were treated for less serious injuries at the scene. Our thoughts are with everyone affected. Over 80 of our medics have responded to this incident, including ambulance crews, advanced paramedics, specialist response teams and an advanced trauma team from London\u2019s air ambulance. We declared a major incident and continue to work closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene. The injured are being treated at five London hospitals: St Mary\u2019s hospital St Thomas\u2019 hospital University College hospital King\u2019s College hospital The Royal London hospital Dozens of Londoners and businesses have opened their doors to people stranded in the capital after the London Bridge attack by sharing offers on social media with the hashtag #SofaForLondon. Nadine Stares said: \u201cSofabed available if you are stranded due to this sad incident at London Bridge #SofaForLondon\u201d. Another Twitter user who gave his name as Ben Andrews, wrote: \u201cIf anyone is caught in London Bridge incident needs place to sleep, we have a spare room 10mins walk away from #London Bridge #sofaforlondon.\u201d The Makersville bike workshop in Hackney tweeted: \u201c#sofaforlondon heads up guys \u2013 if you\u2019re stuck, let us know.\u201d Lots of other people used Twitter to offer help. Three terrorist attackers killed six people and injured 30 in an atrocity that started with them driving a van into people on London Bridge and then stabbing people in nearby Borough Market. Police said they had shot dead all three terrorists \u2013 who were wearing hoax suicide bomb vests \u2013 after armed officers rushed to the scene. People were left fleeing in terror as the attacks unfolded, with gunshots from police ringing out across the streets of central London. Eyewitnesses told tales of horror with terrorists storming into a pub and restaurant to stab people, and of desperate attempts to fend off the the terrorist knifemen who chose to strike at soft targets. The rampage lasted eight minutes, beginning at 10.08pm on Saturday, before the three men suspected of staging the attack were shot dead by police at around 10.16pm. It is the third deadly attack in under three months on Britain, and comes days before the general election on Thursday. Prime minister Theresa May broke off from campaigning and will chair an emergency meeting of the government\u2019s crisis committee Cobra, on Sunday. Footage taken by Lara Al-Ostta shows members of the emergency services helping people who are lying injured on London Bridge: World leaders have sent swift messages of support even as the full extent of the terrorist attacks in London was still unfolding. French president Emmanuel Macron said France was \u201cmore then ever\u201d at the side of the UK. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted about the \u201cawful news from London\u201d and to direct Canadians in need of support to official channels. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said his country\u2019s \u201cprayers and resolute solidarity\u201d were with the people of Britain, and his foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said Australia stood ready to support the British government in responding to the attacks. The president of the EU Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said his thoughts and prayers were with the victims and their families. The White House has provided a readout of a telephone call between Donald Trump and Theresa May: President Donald J Trump spoke with prime minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom today. The president offered his condolences for the brutal terror attacks on June 3 in central London. He praised the heroic response of police and other first responders and offered the full support of the United States government in investigating and bringing those responsible for these heinous acts to justice. Apart from the wounded British Transport Police officer, we have no details yet about the identities of those injured or killed \u2013 including the three suspects who were shot dead by police. Peter Rhodes, London Ambulance Service\u2019s assistant director of operations, said they had taken \u201cover 30 patients to five hospitals across London \u2026 a number of other patients were treated for less serious injuries at the scene\u201d. Those worried about relatives or friends who might have been caught up in the attacks are encouraged to call the Metropolitan police casualty bureau: 0800 096 1233 020 7158 0197 British Transport Police has confirmed one of its on-duty officers was seriously injured in the attack. The male officer was one of the first on the scene \u201cafter he responded to calls for help from the public\u201d, BTP said. His injuries \u2013 to his head, face and leg \u2013 are serious but not thought to be life-threatening. He is currently being treated in a central London hospital. Rowley, taking questions from reporters, clarified that police believe that only the three people shot dead by police were involved in the attack, but said enquiries were ongoing. He did say that suspicions that explosives were involved \u2013 prompted by pictures showing what looked like canisters around a suspect\u2019s chest \u2013 have \u201cnow been ruled out\u201d. Here is the statement from assistant commissioner Mark Rowley: Since late yesterday evening [Saturday, 3 June], the Metropolitan Police Service has been responding to incidents in the London Bridge and Borough Market areas of south London. We are treating this as a terrorist incident and a full investigation is already underway, led by the Met\u2019s Counter Terrorism Command. You will understand that our knowledge of the incident is still growing but what we understand at the present time is: At 22.08 yesterday evening we began to receive reports that a vehicle had struck pedestrians on London Bridge. The vehicle continued to drive from London Bridge to Borough Market. The suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed, including an on-duty British Transport Police officer who was responding to the incident at London Bridge. He received serious but not life-threatening injuries. His family has been informed. Armed officers responded very quickly and bravely, confronting three male suspects who were shot and killed in Borough Market. The suspects had been confronted and shot by the police within eight minutes of the first call. The suspects were wearing what looked like explosive vests but these were later established to be hoaxes. The ongoing operation is led by the Met, working closely with British Transport Police, City of London Police, the London Ambulance Service and the London Fire Brigade. At this stage, we believe that six people have died in addition to the three attackers shot dead by police. And at least 20 casualties have been taken to six hospitals across London, but numbers are still rising. I\u2019d like to repeat our request for the public to avoid the following areas: London Bridge and Borough Market. This is to allow emergency services to deal with this incident. The investigation is being led by the Counter Terrorism Command and we would ask anybody who has images or film of the incident to pass those to police by uploading it at www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk. Our thoughts are with all those involved and those responding to both incidents. Those who are concerned about a loved one can contact the casualty bureau on 0800 0961 233. We are reviewing and planning to strengthen our policing stance across London over the forthcoming days, and there will be additional police and officers deployed across the capital. I would like to ask the public to remain vigilant and let us know if they see anything suspicious that causes them concern and dial 999 immediately. Here are the key facts from that Metropolitan police update: Six people have been killed in terror attacks on London Bridge and at Borough Market. Three male suspects have been shot dead by police. Canisters seen around the body of at least one of the suspects have been \u201cestablished to be hoaxes\u201d, police said. Police believe all of those directly responsible for the attack have been killed. Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner for the Metropolitan police, has confirmed that the vehicle drove from London Bridge to Borough Market, hitting pedestrians on the bridge. There, he said, the suspects left the vehicle and stabbed a number of people, including an on-duty police officer, who sustained serious injuries. Armed response officers confronted three male suspects, who were shot and killed. Rowley says the three suspects were shot within eight minutes of the first call to emergency services. He says the canisters, or vests, seen on the body of at least one suspect, have been \u201cestablished to be hoaxes\u201d. Police confirm three male suspects were shot and killed by armed officers. Six people have been killed, the police have confirmed. Police officers on the scene at Borough Market say the area will be closed for at least 24 hours. Dozens of fire rescue officers in hard hats and overalls are just leaving the scene. Armed officers were protecting a hotel in central London where it is believed witnesses were taken after the incident. The receptionist said the hotel was a \u201ccrisis centre\u201d, but could not tell how many had arrived from London Bridge. Ariana Grande, whose concert in Manchester was the target of a terrorist attack less than two weeks ago, has tweeted her support for those caught up in tonight\u2019s events: Grande is due to lead a tribute concert in Manchester on Sunday evening to commemorate the 22 people killed and support the dozens who were injured. Here is the full statement from the home secretary, Amber Rudd: This was an horrific attack in the heart of our capital city, targeted at people enjoying their evening with friends and family. My thoughts are with the victims and all those affected by this incident. As ever, in difficult and traumatic circumstances, I am extremely proud of and thankful to our police and emergency services who responded so swiftly and those who will work tirelessly as the investigation into this appalling act continues. Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals, the closest to the site of the attacks, are on lockdown \u201cto keep patients, relatives and staff safe\u201d, they have reported, along with Evelina, a children\u2019s hospital in south London. London Ambulance Service has said at least 20 people have been taken to six hospitals across the capital. Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, has issued a statement condemning the attacks on London: I am appalled and angered by the terrorist attacks at London Bridge and Borough Market, in my home city. These acts of violence were truly shocking and I condemn them in the strongest terms. Muslims everywhere are outraged and disgusted at these cowards who once again have destroyed the lives of our fellow Britons. That this should happen in this month of Ramadan, when many Muslims were praying and fasting only goes to show that these people respect neither life nor faith. My prayers are with the victims and all those affected. I commend the work of our emergency services working hard to keep us safe and cope with the ensuing carnage. As ever, we urge everyone to assist the authorities so that these criminals can be apprehended and brought to justice. (A reminder that we do not yet know the perpetrators of this attack and are awaiting further information from police on identities and motives.) One of the questions the latest attack will prompt is why, after more than a decade of relative security, there have suddenly been three major attacks in the course of three months. The police and the British domestic intelligence agency MI5 had a good record in combating terrorism, compared with other European countries such as France and Belgium. After the 2005 London bombing, which killed 52 people plus the four terrorists, MI5 implemented a series of changes, including decentralisation to the Midlands, north of England, Scotland and Wales, to create a better network. The changes seemed to work, with lots of plots stopped. Terrorist attacks until this year were restricted to single fatalities. Among them were the 2007 attack on Glasgow airport in which only the attacker was killed; a Ukrainian rightwing extremist who stabbed a man to death in Birmingham in 2013 and attacked mosques with homemade bombs; the two men who killed the soldier Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013; and the murder of MP Jo Cox last year. Since March there has been the Westminster attack by Khalid Masood, who mowed down pedestrians near parliament and stabbed a policeman, resulting in six deaths, including his own: and the Manchester bombing two weeks ago that killed 22. And now London again. The security services disrupted 18 plots since June 2013 but had recently reported being concerned about an increased tempo in the number of plots. The Met has opened a casualty bureau for those concerned about family and friends who might have been caught up in the attacks. There are two numbers to call: 0800 096 1233 020 7158 0197 Police have asked people who were at the scene on London Bridge or in Borough Market to upload any pictures or videos they have taken to this police site. My colleague Kate Lyons has been talking to people trying to get home with transport disrupted in the wake of the attacks: Some underground lines have reopened and people are unusually chatty on the tube. James Wilesmith, who moved to London from Bournemouth six months ago, was out with Sarah Phillips celebrating her birthday when they got caught up in the events. The pair had seen the Lion King in the West End earlier in the evening before deciding to go for a drink at the Walkie Talkie building, overlooking the river. \u201cWe looked out and were like \u2018oh, look at all the pretty blue lights\u2019 and then we realised, oh no,\u201d said Wilesmith. They got stuck at various cordons and it took them several hours from the time of the attack to make it to a tube station where trains were still running. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in London for six months and there have been two attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you still go on with your life, I still get the tube everyday, but it hits home.\u201d Footage posted by journalist Kaine Pieri shows police officers clearing the area around London Bridge station in the wake of the attack: A statement from the US state department has condemned the attack: The United States condemns the cowardly attacks targeting innocent civilians in London this evening. We understand UK police are currently treating these as terrorist incidents. The United States stands ready to provide any assistance authorities in the United Kingdom may request. Our hearts are with the families and loved ones of the victims. We wish a full and quick recovery to those injured in the attacks. All Americans stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has called the night\u2019s incidents \u201ca horrific attack in the heart of our capital city\u201d. She added: My thoughts are with the victims and all of those affected. Rudd said she was \u201cextremely proud of our emergency services\u201d for their response to the attacks. London Ambulance Service says it has taken at least 20 patients to six hospitals across London: We can confirm we have taken at least 20 patients to six hospitals across London following the incident at London Bridge. We have also treated a number of people at the scene for less serious injuries. We have declared a major incident and continue to work closely with other members of the emergency services. Our priority is to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency and to call NHS 111 for urgent healthcare advice. Owen Evans, 39, was in the Wheatsheaf pub on Stoney Street near Borough Market on Saturday night, with friends, when shooting broke out nearby: I was in the back of the pub. A wave of about 30 people ran in and tried to get into the cellar or cupboard. Then there were shots outside. They didn\u2019t seem real \u2013 like a kid letting off firecrackers. We saw police lights and everyone got down under a table. People turned tables over. We waited about 10 minutes or so, with several shots every couple of minutes. Someone at the front of the pub had been shot \u2013 it\u2019s speculation but we thought it was by accident, there were bullet holes in the windows. The people near the person called for a medic, shouting: \u2018He\u2019s fucking bleeding to death, we need a doctor.\u2019 The bar staff were amazing, I think they locked the door so no one got in. Then they told us to leave the pub and to run, and a policeman standing outside with a gun was shouting, \u2018Go, get the fuck out.\u2019 We ran down the street, turned left at the Market Porter, than ran down the road and away. We got to the South Bank and then waited ages for a tube, and eventually got home. The Metropolitan police have confirmed at least one armed officer had opened fire during the attack at Borough market. In information posted on Twitter, they said: \u201cArmed officers responded and shots have been fired.\u201d The Met has not said whether the shots fired by their officer struck anyone or stopped a suspect. Pictures have been circulating showing a man on the ground; he appears to have canisters strapped to his body. The Guardian is not showing his face until his identity and connection to the incident has been established. The photo was taken by Gabriele Sciotto, a Juventus fan, who said he was on his way home after watching his team play in the Champions League final. \u201cI had just been watching the football at The Sheaf pub and I left. I was trying to figure out which way to go home and I went the wrong way.\u201d As he walked down Park Street he said a man came running towards him. \u201cHe was maybe 35. He was saying \u2018run away, there\u2019s a terrorist attack going on\u2019. There were other people around and they started to run away.\u201d Sciotto, a documentary maker, instead walked on: I\u2019m a documentary maker. I was doing what I\u2019m trained to do. It was dark, but behind him I could see three men at the other end of the street. They were about 20 metres away. It was quite confusing \u2013 it took me a few seconds to work out what was going on. Sciotto said he saw them run in the opposite direction into Borough Market: There was one policeman there, inside Borough Market. He was trying to scare them away. They ran towards me because the police officer was trying to chase them. The three men ran out of Borough Market and turned left into Stoney Street towards the Wheatsheaf pub: Suddenly lots and lots of police came from the other direction. There was a lot of shouting. \u2018Stop, stop, get on the floor\u2019, stuff like that. Then the police shot them. The 25-year-old took pictures of the men after they had been shot, lying on the floor: I could see one of them moving still. There was blood. I could see the police were scared. The policeman in Borough Market, he was trying to make sure that no one was hurt. He was trying to get them outside. The police reaction was very quick. The Metropolitan police have issued a statement clarifying the timeline of events: From 22.08hrs [on] 3 June officers responded to reports of a vehicle in collision with pedestrians on London Bridge. Officers have then responded to reports of stabbings in Borough Market. Armed officers responded and shots have been fired. Officers subsequently responded to an incident in the Vauxhall area. At 00.25hrs [on] 4 June the incidents at London Bridge and Borough Market were declared as terrorist incidents. The incident at Vauxhall is a stabbing and is not believed connected to the other two incidents. We will release facts when we can \u2013 our info must be accurate. We urge the public to remain calm, but be alert and vigilant. To anyone near an incident our advice is RUN \u2013 HIDE \u2013 TELL. My colleague Colin Blackstock has been speaking to witnesses close to the scene: The police cordons made it difficult for people to get where they were going and a number of people staying in hotels in the area have been unable to return to their rooms. Elaine and Louise from Lurgan in Northern Ireland had been to the Olympic stadium in Stratford to see Depeche Mode. They were staying at the Premier Inn on Bankside but have been unable to get back to their hotel. \u201cWe were at the concert when people started messaging us to ask us if we were OK because something had happened on London Bridge and they knew we were staying near there,\u201d said Elaine. They were able to get a tube back to Southwark but found that the police cordon meant there was no way to get to their hotel. \u201cNow we\u2019re stuck in London with nowhere to go and no sense of direction and sore feet,\u201d Louise said. They had tried calling their hotel but there was no answer, so after an hour of walking around trying to find somewhere to stay they were going to another Premier inn at Tower Bridge to see if the hotel would put them up for the night. An editor in the Sun\u2019s London Bridge Street office says police confirmed that a number of blasts heard in the last 45 minutes were controlled explosions. The attacks at London Bridge and Borough Market are the third suspected terrorist attack on the UK since March. The incidents come after 10 weeks of intense activity for counter-terrorism investigators, which before Saturday had seen two plots escape detection and lead to mass casualties, and five alleged attack plots thwarted. The first plot to kill was aimed at the Westminster area of central London on 22 March, when an attacker killed four people after mounting the pavement and mowing down pedestrians, before running into the Houses of Parliaments where a police officer was stabbed to death. After that attack, five further plots were disrupted with suspects detained, as well as four alleged conspiracies in London and one in Birmingham. On 22 May, a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured more than 100 at Manchester Arena after attacking a pop concert attended by many children and youngsters. The Manchester attacker, Salman Abedi, was feared to have co-conspirators and concerns they may be on the loose led to the UK\u2019s terrorism threat level being raised to its maximum, amid fears another attack may have been imminent. The threat level was lowered to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely, last Saturday. Reports of further blasts close to London Bridge: three were heard about half an hour ago. It is not clear if these were controlled explosions deployed by the police. Scotland Yard has not yet commented on them. My colleague Chris Johnston is at the scene and has been speaking to witnesses: Gerard Vowls, 47, had been watching the Champions League final at the Ship pub in Borough. He was at the start of the south side of London Bridge and saw a woman being stabbed by three men. \u201cI want to know if this girl is still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking around for an hour and a half crying my eyes out. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Vowls said he was throwing chairs, glasses and bottles at the attackers in a bid to stop them. \u201cThey kept coming to try to stab me \u2026 they were stabbing everyone. Evil, evil people.\u201d It took at least 10 minutes for armed police to reach the scene, he added. There will be a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra meeting on Sunday morning, confirms Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who will attend. In a statement, Khan said: The Metropolitan police are responding to the horrific terrorist attack at London Bridge and Borough Market. My thoughts are with everyone affected, and I\u2019d like to thank the brave men and women of our emergency services who were first on the scene and will be working throughout the night. I am in close contact with the Met commissioner and senior officers and am being kept updated on all developments. I will be attending the government\u2019s emergency Cobra meeting later this morning. London Bridge Station is closed and we are asking people to avoid the area. The situation is still unfolding and I would ask all Londoners and visitors to our city to remain calm and vigilant. Please report anything suspicious to the police, but only call 999 in an emergency. We don\u2019t yet know the full details, but this was a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners and visitors to our city enjoying their Saturday night. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. There is no justification whatsoever for such barbaric acts. For further updates or information please follow the Metropolitan police on Twitter. My colleague Carmen Fishwick is at Liverpool Street, outside the Andaz hotel where at least two people are being treated: one with a head injury and a woman in a wheelchair. She reports: I spoke to a man who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the attack, whose car has been impounded by police. A 25-year-old man, who wishes to remain anonymous, was driving across the bridge when he saw a man and a pregnant woman unconscious on the road. He says they were there for at least five minutes before the emergency services arrived. \u201cWe thought it was a car accident but as we got closer we could see a lot of blood and bodies. There was a pregnant woman on the right who was severely injured and on the left there was a man being resuscitated, but he started breathing. We don\u2019t know whether the woman survived. \u201cWe had to get out of the car and there were lots of people screaming. And then ambulances arrived. It was a shocking experience.\u201d Staff at the offices of the Sun newspaper on London Bridge Street reported hearing two explosions close by at 1.23am and 1.25am. A third explosion was reported close to the Shard at 1.28am. It is not clear if these were controlled explosions by police on the scene. Guardian reporter Lisa O\u2019Carroll is at Borough Market, where she says multiple stabbings have been reported: Witnesses said they saw two men stabbing people outside the well-known Roast restaurant in Borough market. A chef from the nearby Fish restaurant said: \u201cI saw two guys with big knives downstairs outside Roast. They were stabbing people. The police were running away, they were community police. They were normal officers, they were running away. \u201cThe guy with the knife was killing two people. We were shouting \u2018stop, stop\u2019 and people threw chairs at them. Police came and shot straight away.\u201d Another staff member from Fish said: \u201cI saw two people in Breadhead bakery, they had blood on them, they were civilians. I never expected to see this happen here.\u201d Neither wanted to give their names. Donald Trump\u2019s first response to the news of the London attacks was to retweet a conservative news website better known for sensationalism and partisanship than for accurate reporting. It is unclear whether the president received any intelligence briefing of his own about the attacks before he saw the tweet from the Drudge Report: That was what he passed on under his personal Twitter account. White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted: Trump\u2019s tweet came from his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, and was retweeted by the @POTUS handle. NBC Nightly News felt the need to caution its audience about the credibility of the information that the president was passing on. The channel put out its own tweet in response: Some 40 minutes after his original reflex response, Trump sent out a second tweet, making a political point from the unfolding horror in London, arguing that it added weight to his efforts to get a travel ban imposed on travellers from six predominantly Muslim countries. Trump\u2019s executive order has been blocked by a succession of courts and the matter is now before the supreme court. The tweet provoked a storm of criticism from commentators who saw it as a piece of opportunism at London\u2019s expense. Eight minutes later, Trump sent out a third, more supportive tweet, closer to a more normal response from a world leader when an ally comes under attack: The tweet was echoed by vice-president Mike Pence: The London Ambulance Service assistant director of operations, Peter Rhodes, has issued a statement on the medical response: We are responding to an incident alongside other emergency services at London Bridge. We have sent a number of ambulance crews, advanced paramedics and specialist response teams to the scene, with the first of our medics arriving in six minutes. An advanced trauma team from London\u2019s air ambulance has also been dispatched by car. We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to get people to safety and ensure they receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. Our initial priority is to assess the level and nature of injuries, and ensure that those people in most need are treated first and taken to hospital. More information will follow when we have it. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog. Here is a brief recap of what we know so far: Police have declared two incidents in the capital \u2013 in London Bridge and Borough Market \u2013 as acts of terrorism. On London Bridge a van was driven, apparently deliberately, into pedestrians. At Borough Market there are reports of multiple stabbings. A third incident, a stabbing at Vauxhall, is not thought to be connected, police have said. It is not yet known if there are fatalities, or how many people have been hurt, but there are \u201cmultiple casualties\u201d, according to the Metropolitan police. We will keep you updated with all developments on the live blog. Australian senator Sam Dastyari was at a restaurant near London Bridge at the time of the attack. He told the ABC the scenes were \u201cquite horrific\u201d, and that it was difficult to know what was going on as he and others were evacuated, as people got tidbits of information from text messages and other individuals. \u201cPeople were afraid. There is a real lack of information although that\u2019s obviously natural,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific. When we were evacuated from the site, going past who were obviously victims 10 to 15 metres from where you were eating 20 minutes earlier, it\u2019s very confronting.\u201d Dastyari said the number of armed police who quickly appeared showed how seriously they were taking the incident, and praised the professionalism of the police force. He said he\u2019d spoken with London mayor, Sadiq Khan, about the Manchester attack, and Khan said \u201cthe reality was we had to be ready for these kind of incidents now\u201d. Guardian journalist Peter Walker was near the scene and witnessed members of the public trying to leave the area. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve just been around much of the police cordon close to London Bridge and Borough, and there is still a very fast-changing, chaotic situation going on. \u201cThe area has been hastily cordoned off with police tape, but it is full of small side alleys, where some of the cordons have no officers stationed. There are a lot of people lost and trying to find their way home and I witnessed a coupe walk past the tape \u2013 some had fallen to the floor \u2013 only to be spotted by an officer who yelled, \u2018Get back! Get back!\u2019 at them, with real urgency. \u201cAll the while there is a stream of police vans and cars, and fire engines and ambulances streaming to and fro, and more police, some in protective riot-type gear. There are still a lot of people about \u2013 this is a hugely busy area on a Saturday night ... most are trying to work out how to get home. \u201cI went past King\u2019s College hospital, one of London\u2019s main emergency centres, a few miles to the south. It had ambulances arriving even then, and a red foldout sign pointing people to the major incident centre inside.\u201d Emergency services responding to the incidents at London Bridge and Borough Market have confirmed that they were terrorist attacks. The Metropolitan police said: \u201c The incident at Vauxhall is a stabbing and is not connected to the incidents at London Bridge and Borough Market.\u201d Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said: Guardian journalist Kate Lyons has more on the evacuations going on in the area around London Bridge. Guests at hotels in the vicinity of the attack have been evacuated. Zaven Jordan who is visiting from Australia was staying in Novotel Southwark and was woken by a fire alarm. When guests assembled outside the hotel he said police told everyone to run. \u201cThe police didn\u2019t just give directions, they were yelling \u2018run!\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a fire alarm goes off you expect to assemble and then go back inside in a few minutes. We grabbed our passports just in case, but we weren\u2019t really ready for this.\u201d He is walking the streets trying to find somewhere to stay. He says the hotel is not answering their phone, he had been turned away by another hotel and he is uncertain where in the city it is safe to go. Sky News have reported a statement from Theresa May: \u201cFollowing updates from police and security officials, I can confirm that the terrible incident in London is being treated as a potential act of terrorism. \u201cThis is a fast-moving investigation. I want to express my huge gratitude to the police and emergency services who are on the scene. Our thoughts are with those who are caught up in these dreadful events.\u201d Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said he is in contact with the Metropolitan police commissioner. Guardian journalist Chris Johnston is in the area of London Bridge, and says emergency services are continuing to descend on the area. He says a fire brigade command vehicle and operational support trucks and six fire engines just crossed Borough High Street along with two ambulances. Meanwhile, life boats are coordinating with emergency services to evacuate members of the public on the Thames: Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said on Twitter: \u201cBrutal and shocking incidents reported in London. My thoughts are with the victims and their families. Thank you to the emergency services.\u201d Guardian journalist Kate Lyons is continuing to speak to people near the scene at London Bridge: Leon Radschinski, a bartender who was working tonight at Caravan Bankside, a restaurant near London Bridge said they stopped serving after they began hearing reports of an attack, before police ran into the restaurant ordering everyone to get out and run south. Radschiski has made it out of the cordoned area and is trying to make it home on a Boris bike. The streets around London Bridge, outside of the cordoned area, are full of people desperately trying to get home. The underground and trains are not running and taxis are hard to come by. One woman, visiting London from Yorkshire for a wedding, was in tears at the shock of the evening and overwhelmed at trying to find a way to her accommodation in Crystal Palace. Strangers are stopping to help one another in the street \u2013 offering advice on the best routes back and looking up locations for those without phones or GPS. Guardian journalists at the scene are continuing to get eye-witness testimony of how the attack unfolded. Olivia Doyle, 23, was travelling across London Bridge in a car with three family members, arriving to the sound of sirens. She told the Guardian: \u201cWe arrived to see paramedics running to injured people. There were two people lying on the north end, on the east side of the bridge, just off the pavement. There were bits of what looked like car wreckage. We thought it was bits of bike or something. I saw four or five people lying on the ground, but everyone I saw was alive. \u201cIt seemed like some kind of vehicle had knocked people down. They were two or three minutes walk apart, it obviously wasn\u2019t an accident. \u201cI saw armed police officers shouting at people to stay in their cars, and pedestrians running past us off the bridge. \u201cWe got out of our car and started running, then realised that we\u2019d be better off in the car and we could be blocking the road, and the road was clear behind us except for a taxi that had been abandoned.\u201d The prime minister, Theresa May, who has been campaigning in the general election, was returning to Downing Street to receive further briefings from security officials, No 10 has confirmed. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the US president, Donald Trump, has been briefed on the incident by his national security team. The US president has recently tweeted: Police are responding to reports of at least three incidents across parts of London. The incidents are on London Bridge, Borough market and Vauxhall. The first report was of a van ploughing into pedestrians on London Bridge. Witnesses say the van was reported to have swerved onto the pavement and there have been unconfirmed reports of gunfire. A second incident is ongoing in Borough Market where there are reports of multiple stabbings. Police say they are responding to a third event at Vauxhall. Downing Street says the prime minister has been informed of a major incident. Police are urging people to stay away from the affected areas. Police have established cordons around the scene at London Bridge. Police are continuing to urge members of the public to reach areas of safety. The Metropolitan police are urging people in the areas of the incident in Vauxhall, London Bridge and Borough Market to get to safer areas away from the scenes. Guardian journalist Kate Lyons has spoken to witnesses at the scene at London Bridge, who report stabbings have taken place: Lara Al-Ostta was having drinks with a friend at the Old Thameside Inn underneath London Bridge when she said people came running into the pub and telling everyone to run away because \u201cpeople are stabbing each other\u201d. Al-Ostta said she ended running up on to London Bridge \u2013 and she and her friend were told by the police to run away. While on the bridge Al-Ostta took video, seen by the Guardian, of at least three injured people on the bridge, being tended to by emergency services. \u201cI saw people moving, but we thought fuck this is a serious thing,\u201d said Al-Ostta. Stephen Tull, who is homeless, was under the bridge at the time of the attack when he heard a bang. He says he ran up on to the bridge to help and saw one man who jumped out of the van and began attacking people. Reuters have posted footage from the police cordon at London Bridge. The police say officers are also responding to an incident in Vauxhall. Metropolitan police have confirmed reports of stabbings at Borough Market, where they say armed police have fired shots. Journalists at the scene at London Bridge have been removed from the area by armed police. Theresa May is aware of the incidents going on in London tonight. A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe Prime Minister is in contact with officials and is being regularly updated on the incident at London Bridge.\u201d There are already offers of help coming in for those around the area of the attack, with one person offering minicab rides: Will Heaven, a Spectator journalist who was passing London Bridge minutes after the incident, has told Sky News what he saw: \u201cIt was about 10 past 10. I was in the back of an Uber cab driving south over London Bridge. \u201cSuddenly on the left hand side on the bridge there was somebody down on the pavement with a small crowd around them, clearly concerned. I thought someone had collapsed. We drove a little further over the bridge. There was another person in the road itself. The penny dropped that something quite serious was happening. \u201cThe traffic came to a standstill. The Uber driver said something bad is happening here. We could hear sirens coming.\u201d Footage is emerging of the public reaction to the incident on London Bridge. People in a bar were ordered to get back from doors and take cover as it unfolded. The Metropolitan police say they are also responding to a second incident at Borough Market. Our picture editor has sourced an image of the van thought to have struck pedestrians on London Bridge this evening. Latika Bourke is also reporting injured people being treated on the footpath of Southwark Street. Latika Bourke, a journalist from Fairfax Media, has posted footage of people fleeing London Bridge as emergency services continue their work: Police are treating injured people and carrying them away at the end of Thrale Street. Members of the public were told by police to \u201crun as fast as they could\u201d westbound. Nick Archer, who was in the London Bridge area, told Sky News: \u201cWe came out (of a bar) on to the road and looked and looked to my left and there as a guy, I thought he was just drinking but he was lying on the floor. And then a couple of seconds later, about three police vans flew past. \u201cHe looked in a bad way.\u201d Holly Jones, a BBC reporter at the bridge when the incident happened, said a van had swerved off the road into a crowd of pedestrians. \u201cA white van driver came speeding \u2013 probably about 50mph \u2013 veered off the road into the crowds of people who were walking along the pavement,\u201d she told BBC News. \u201cHe swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people. He hit about two people in front of me and then three behind. I\u2019d say there are about four severely injured people. They all have paramedics assisting them at the moment,\u201d she said. A journalist working for the Spectator magazine has reported seeing armed police and injured people in the area \u2013 with social media showing a large number of emergency service vehicles at the scene. London Bridge has been closed after an incident on Saturday night, after witnesses said a van had hit pedestrians. There are reports of casualties, with a witness telling the BBC that van had veered off the road and struck people.",

Emmanuel Macron, the president of France \u2013 which has sadly faced its own share of terror attacks \u2013 said his nation was \u201cmore than ever\u201d at the side of the UK. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted about the \u201cawful news from London\u201d and directed Canadians in need of support to official channels. Not all leaders\u2019 messages were greeted warmly. US president Donald Trump was accused of political opportunism after tweeting that the London attacks helped build the case for a Muslim travel ban. \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d he said. * * * Offers of help As the security operation forced parts of the capital\u2019s transport network to shut down, London residents took to social media to offer help to those stranded. Under the #SofaForLondon hashtag, people opened their homes to give people a place to stop \u2013 one helpfully tweeting a map of gurdwaras in London that would shelter them. Witnesses also reported hotels and restaurants the length of the southern bank of the Thames giving people water and a place to recover as they tried to make their way home. * * * Sunday\u2019s late editions The first editions of the Sunday newspapers will not have carried the dreadful events. Here are the later editions. * * * Contact information The Met has opened a casualty bureau for those concerned about family and friends who might have been caught up in the attacks. There are two numbers to call: 0800 096 1233 020 7158 0197 Emergency services have urged people to dial 999 only when it is a genuine emergency. The London Ambulance Service says people can dial 111 if they need medical assistance. If you have pictures or video, the police have requested footage be uploaded to this site. We also have a Guardian Witness callout for any accounts of what happened. * * * If you would like to receive the Guardian Morning Briefing by email every weekday at 7am, sign up here.",

Shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy released a joint statement rejecting Trump\u2019s assertion that the climate deal can be redrafted. \u201cWe deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible, and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,\u201d said German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni.

World leaders had already begun preparing for a US exit. China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, said on Thursday that fighting climate change was a \u201cglobal consensus\u201d and an \u201cinternational responsibility\u201d. The EU and China have forged a new alliance on climate change and are currently midway through a summit in Brussels at the end of which they will announce plans to step up efforts. The EU\u2019s commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, said Trump\u2019s unilateral decision marked a sad day for the global community, but he vowed the accord would endure. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement has galvanised us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership. Europe and its strong partners all around the world are ready to lead the way,\u201d he said. The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, said: \u201cIt is a matter of trust and leadership. This decision will hurt the US and the planet.\u201d Izabella Teixeira, who lead the Brazilian negotiating team in 2015, described Trump\u2019s announcement as a \u201cheart attack\u201d but said the world would survive. She dismissed suggestions that any new deal would have to ignore US historical emissions. \u201cThese are old ideas, old politics,\u201d she told the Guardian. United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the decision was a \u201cmajor disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security\u201d. The Indian government did not immediately react to Trump\u2019s announcement, which came shortly after 1am local time, but India\u2019s energy minister recently reaffirmed the south Asian giant\u2019s commitment to the global climate agreement. The world\u2019s third-largest carbon pollution emitter is on course to exceed the renewable energy targets it set in Paris in 2015 by nearly 50%, and three years ahead of schedule. Trump\u2019s withdrawal announcement came in the late evening in Russia, and official commentary was not immediately available. But Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said earlier on Thursday that Russia \u201cattaches great importance\u201d to the Paris climate accord, and a US withdrawal could complicate the agreement\u2019s implementation. \u201cOf course, the effectiveness and realisation of this convention will be hampered without key participants,\u201d Peskov told journalists. \u201cThere is no alternative (to the accord) at this time.\u201d The US has long been a key \u2013 though not always enthusiastic \u2013 player in international efforts to mitigate the already apparent trends of increasing temperatures, rising sea levels and more frequent and intense droughts, floods and storms. Trump is accused of jettisoning this international role and putting the domestic fossil fuel industry first. Though his term may be too short to complete the job he has begun. Lukas Hermwille, scientific researcher in the field of international climate policy at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, drew attention to the fact that the exit from the agreement would anyway only come into effect in around three years\u2019 time \u201cironically\u201d, he told Die Welt, \u201con the day after the next US presidential election\u201d. But Trump could still spend the rest of his time in office torpedoing climate protection from the inside out, he added. Environmental groups were appalled. Tanya Steele, CEO of WWF said the decision makes it harder for the world to reach a safer and more prosperous future. \u201cIt is hugely disappointing that President Trump is making the mistake in rowing back on the Paris agreement,\u201d she said, \u201cClimate change is a very real global issue that affects the successful future of our planet.\u201d Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory said the decision \u201ccreates the risk of a domino effect\u201d that could put the target of keeping temperature rises below 2C (3.6F) out of reach, though he held out hope that global talks can make greater progress in reducing fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy in the absence of a country that has flitted back and forth between leadership and obstruction. Many US mayors have said they will abide by climate commitments regardless of the White House U-turn. This was echoed by municipal leaders overseas. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who chairs a group of 40 major cities, said: \u201cNo matter what decision is made by the White House, cities are honouring their responsibilities to implement the Paris agreement. There is no alternative for the future of our planet.\u201d Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris, Alec Luhn in Moscow and Michael Safi in Delhi",

And if we can, that\u2019s great. And if we can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So that\u2019s that. After months of fevered speculation and lobbying, Trump sticks to his campaign pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-confirms-us-will-quit-paris-climate-deal\">withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord</a>. He does so with a caveat that\u2019s delivered rather casually \u2013 the US will renegotiate this pact, or maybe some other pact, aimed at ensuring the future liveability of the planet. But if it doesn\u2019t work out, that\u2019s OK.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7m lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Trump\u2019s vision of a hobbled America, ransacked by pointless environmental regulation, draws upon a highly disputed <a href=\"http://www.energyxxi.org/new-report-examines-costs-us-industrial-sector-obama%E2%80%99s-paris-pledge\">study published in March</a>. National Economic Research Associates has done work for front groups for coal companies in the past and this study was at the behest of the American Council for Capital Formation, which counts Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and Charles Koch <a href=\"https://www.desmogblog.com/american-council-for-capital-formation\">as major donors</a>.<br></p> \n<p>The Paris agreement itself places no \u201cenergy restrictions\u201d on the US \u2013 it\u2019s a voluntary agreement that leaves it up to countries to decide how to cut their emissions. But several economists have warned that leaving the Paris agreement will stymie clean energy investment and ensure the production of solar panels and wind turbines \u2013 the very blue-collar jobs Trump claims to value \u2013 will take place in China rather than the US.</p> \n<p>It could get worse still \u2013 some countries are mulling a carbon \u201ctariff\u201d on US goods over Trump\u2019s decision to swim against the energy transition that is underway. None of this will help a coal industry that was in decline long before the Paris deal. This is perhaps why business support for Paris is broad, uniting the likes of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/870396195562074114\">Facebook</a>, Goldman Sachs, Apple and even BP.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years \u2013 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Trump repeatedly touches on a familiar theme of the US being taken advantage of by foreign ingrates. The Paris deal was considered a breakthrough because it required all nations to curb their emissions \u2013 including, crucially, China and India. Given that both these countries do not have more than a century of mass industrialization behind them, unlike the US, their commitments should be seen in context. Indeed, recent analysis has shown that China may have already peaked its coal use and will be reducing its emissions sooner than expected, although suspicions linger over its accounting methods.</p> \n<p>Either way, both China and India have reiterated their commitment to the Paris deal in recent weeks and are investing heavily in renewable energy. That they are doing this with tens of millions of their people still without electricity and other basic services shows that perhaps it isn\u2019t terribly unfair to expect the world\u2019s wealthiest nation to do likewise.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>In short, the agreement doesn\u2019t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://energy.gov/downloads/2017-us-energy-and-employment-report\">According to the Department of Energy</a>, there are about 373,000 Americans working in solar energy \u2013 more than double that of the coal industry. The coal sector has been shedding jobs for decades, driven by automation of work and, more recently, the abundance of cheap natural gas.</p> \n<p>Major coal mining firms have conceded those jobs aren\u2019t coming back and it\u2019s not quite clear how American mining jobs can be shifted overseas given the US isn\u2019t a coal exporter and US power plants aren\u2019t crying out for extra minerals to keep the lights on. What\u2019s more likely, according to economists, is that growth in renewable energy innovation and construction jobs will tip overseas, probably to China, which has committed to investing $360bn in the sector in the coming years.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Our country will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This dark vision would perhaps approach reality if a.) the only source of electricity in the US was coal, rather than a mix of nuclear, gas, coal and renewables, b.) the Paris agreement set any sort of binding limit on energy sources, and c.) the US government followed through with this by shutting down power plants rather than asking states to submit plans to transition away from polluting fossil fuels (as the Obama administration did). None of that has actually happened or was slated to happen.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree \u2013 think of that; this much \u2013 Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>White House \u201ctalking points\u201d distributed before Trump\u2019s speech cite MIT research for the 0.2-degree reduction. This prompted a <a href=\"https://www.climateinteractive.org/insights/response-to-white-house-talking-points-on-paris-agreement/\">swift rebuttal from the actual source</a>, a collaboration between MIT and Climate Interactive. The researchers point out the reduction in expected warming from emissions cuts promised at Paris will be 0.9 degrees by 2100, not 0.2 degrees.</p> \n<p>This still won\u2019t be enough to avoid breaching the warming limit set out in the Paris deal but it\u2019s worth considering that 0.9C is roughly the global temperature rise experienced since the industrial revolution.

          "bodyText": "So we\u2019re getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great. And if we can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine. So that\u2019s that. After months of fevered speculation and lobbying, Trump sticks to his campaign pledge to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord. He does so with a caveat that\u2019s delivered rather casually \u2013 the US will renegotiate this pact, or maybe some other pact, aimed at ensuring the future liveability of the planet. But if it doesn\u2019t work out, that\u2019s OK. Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7m lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates. Trump\u2019s vision of a hobbled America, ransacked by pointless environmental regulation, draws upon a highly disputed study published in March. National Economic Research Associates has done work for front groups for coal companies in the past and this study was at the behest of the American Council for Capital Formation, which counts Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and Charles Koch as major donors. The Paris agreement itself places no \u201cenergy restrictions\u201d on the US \u2013 it\u2019s a voluntary agreement that leaves it up to countries to decide how to cut their emissions. But several economists have warned that leaving the Paris agreement will stymie clean energy investment and ensure the production of solar panels and wind turbines \u2013 the very blue-collar jobs Trump claims to value \u2013 will take place in China rather than the US. It could get worse still \u2013 some countries are mulling a carbon \u201ctariff\u201d on US goods over Trump\u2019s decision to swim against the energy transition that is underway. None of this will help a coal industry that was in decline long before the Paris deal. This is perhaps why business support for Paris is broad, uniting the likes of Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Apple and even BP. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years \u2013 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years. Not us. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. There are many other examples. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States. Trump repeatedly touches on a familiar theme of the US being taken advantage of by foreign ingrates. The Paris deal was considered a breakthrough because it required all nations to curb their emissions \u2013 including, crucially, China and India. Given that both these countries do not have more than a century of mass industrialization behind them, unlike the US, their commitments should be seen in context. Indeed, recent analysis has shown that China may have already peaked its coal use and will be reducing its emissions sooner than expected, although suspicions linger over its accounting methods. Either way, both China and India have reiterated their commitment to the Paris deal in recent weeks and are investing heavily in renewable energy. That they are doing this with tens of millions of their people still without electricity and other basic services shows that perhaps it isn\u2019t terribly unfair to expect the world\u2019s wealthiest nation to do likewise. In short, the agreement doesn\u2019t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. According to the Department of Energy, there are about 373,000 Americans working in solar energy \u2013 more than double that of the coal industry. The coal sector has been shedding jobs for decades, driven by automation of work and, more recently, the abundance of cheap natural gas. Major coal mining firms have conceded those jobs aren\u2019t coming back and it\u2019s not quite clear how American mining jobs can be shifted overseas given the US isn\u2019t a coal exporter and US power plants aren\u2019t crying out for extra minerals to keep the lights on. What\u2019s more likely, according to economists, is that growth in renewable energy innovation and construction jobs will tip overseas, probably to China, which has committed to investing $360bn in the sector in the coming years. Our country will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life. This dark vision would perhaps approach reality if a.) the only source of electricity in the US was coal, rather than a mix of nuclear, gas, coal and renewables, b.) the Paris agreement set any sort of binding limit on energy sources, and c.) the US government followed through with this by shutting down power plants rather than asking states to submit plans to transition away from polluting fossil fuels (as the Obama administration did). None of that has actually happened or was slated to happen. Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree \u2013 think of that; this much \u2013 Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. Tiny, tiny amount. White House \u201ctalking points\u201d distributed before Trump\u2019s speech cite MIT research for the 0.2-degree reduction. This prompted a swift rebuttal from the actual source, a collaboration between MIT and Climate Interactive. The researchers point out the reduction in expected warming from emissions cuts promised at Paris will be 0.9 degrees by 2100, not 0.2 degrees. This still won\u2019t be enough to avoid breaching the warming limit set out in the Paris deal but it\u2019s worth considering that 0.9C is roughly the global temperature rise experienced since the industrial revolution. People living in southern Florida, or Bangladesh or beside a coral reef that provides food and a livelihood would have radically different lives if the global temperature increase was double its current level. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We\u2019ll be the cleanest. We\u2019re going to have the cleanest air. We\u2019re going to have the cleanest water. Under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has paused or scrapped rules that prevent the dumping of mining waste into streams, curb emissions from vehicles and power plants and stop mercury and arsenic seeping into waterways. The EPA\u2019s proposed budget also cuts measures that prevent lead in drinking water and also scraps clean-ups of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico and shrinks the funding of enforcement of pollution rules. And we\u2019ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris accord or something that we can do that\u2019s much better than the Paris accord. And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled. But until we do that, we\u2019re out of the agreement. In common with some other policy areas, Trump seems to be believe his negotiating skills can overcome issues that leaders have grappled with for years. Paris came about after 20 years of often painful incremental manoeuvrings that included the disappointment of Copenhagen in 2009, and world leaders have already made clear they aren\u2019t \u201cthrilled\u201d at the prospect of reversing this breakthrough. France, Italy and Germany released a statement saying that the Paris deal can\u2019t be redone, while the EU and China jointly declared the agreement was \u201cirreversible\u201d. The UK, Canada and Australia all reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement with Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, saying he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with Trump\u2019s decision. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called it a \u201cmajor disappointment.\u201d The US may return to Paris, with Trump or a future president, but there will be lingering diplomatic damage that will haunt the country on the international stage far more than the Kyoto reversal under George W Bush. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? Well, at this point there\u2019s certainly not much laughter. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Here, Trump seems to confuse the venue of the UN climate agreement signing for the actual subject of the accord. It\u2019s also worth noting that Bill Peduto, mayor of Pittsburgh, committed the city to the Paris deal, along with dozens of other US municipalities, after Trump\u2019s announcement. About 65,000 people in Pennsylvania work in the renewable energy industry, more than mining, oil and gas combined. Of course, the world\u2019s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated. Again Trump portrays the Paris deal as an onerous ball and chain around the ankle of a struggling America, which somehow isn\u2019t now one of the world\u2019s leading polluters. The climate fund is voluntary and Barack Obama pledged about $3bn to it. Given the scale of the climate challenge \u2013 rising seas, drought and disasters are already estimated to displace about 20 million people a year, according to the UN \u2013 even this funding is likely to be insufficient.

Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. One of the \u2013 ultimately successful \u2013 arguments put by opponents of the Paris deal to Trump was that his domestic agenda of revoking Obama-era environmental regulations would be jeopardised by the agreement.

          "bodyText": "Frustration is spilling over in Caracas. After marches nationwide for nearly two months, a pattern has emerged to the near-daily protests. It starts with large groups of people, walking peacefully. They encounter national guardsmen. The march goes no farther. Rubber bullets and teargas rain down, violence escalates, and the young firebrands driving for change in this troubled nation step forward. In this edition of the Guardian Weekly, we look in some detail at what\u2019s sustaining the dismay. The forces are economic and political, reports Virginia L\u00f3pez, as Venezuela\u2019s president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro attempts to redraft the constitution and delay elections. Our Americas coverage is strong elsewhere too. From Toronto, Ashifa Kassam asks if prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s staged media moments have gone too far. Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega dies at the age of 83. And we\u2019ve got the twists and turns of the Trump administration covered, as the president returns from a trip overseas and logs on very quickly indeed to social media site Twitter. From Europe, we report on last weekend\u2019s Group of Seven meeting, after which the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told a rally that the US and UK could no longer be completely relied upon. Merkel said Europeans were now firmly in charge of their own fate. Is this the end of the western alliance? Tough questions from a strong leader, who faces an election at home in September. Our world diary visits Isfahan (a place your GW team would also like to see ...), and meets the Iranians helping their country to open up. In Asia, meanwhile, we explain unrest on the Philippine island of Mindanao. With an general election looming on 8 June in Britain, our UK news pages catch up with the latest election polls, and assess the cost of pledges made by both the Conservatives and Labour. And we keep you up to date on investigations in the wake of the terrorist attack in Manchester last week that killed 22 concert-goers and left dozens injured. Our editorial leaders recognise a constitutional court ruling in Taiwan that favours same-sex marriage. And our lettersspeak to protecting the past, the need for cyber-vigilance, and expatriate voting. We welcome letters for publication that reflect on the content of the Weekly.

Trump retained the option of pulling out of the treaty altogether or, more likely, scaling back on the specific commitments made by the Obama administration. Obama pledged to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26%-28 % below 2005 levels by 2025. Computer simulations suggest earth temperatures could rise by as much 0.2C if the US pulled out of the UN treaty altogether. Feverish negotiations by G7 officials until 3am on Saturday failed to forge a closer consensus, reviving the era when George W Bush was alone among G7 leaders in expressing scepticism about climate change. The White House had signalled at the start of Trump\u2019s tour of the Middle East and Europe that the US would not make a decision on climate change until after the summit, but other G7 leaders, such as Merkel and Macron, hoped they could collectively persuade Trump to commit to the principles of the Paris accord. During the presidential campaign Trump railed against the damage the Paris deal would inflict on traditional US industry. At the summit, his aides said that although his own views were evolving, he would always put the interests of US industry first. In an assertion of US unilateral power, Trump also forced the Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni \u2013 the summit host \u2013 to shred plans for an ambitious statement stressing the plight of migrants was a global rather than regional responsibility. Italy had chosen Sicily as the venue for the summit as the symbolic bridge between Europe and Africa. As many as 200,000 migrants are due to reach Italy this year from Libya, and already more than 1,300 have drowned seeking to make the crossing. During the two-day summit in Taormina, the Libyan capital Tripoli has seen more than 50 deaths in militia infighting, Egypt has twice bombed alleged Islamist training camps in southern Libya, and more than 2,000 refugees have crossed the Mediterranean to the Italian mainland, with scores drowning. Italy had planned a five-page G7 statement on human mobility, stressing migrants\u2019 rights, their positive contribution to host nations and the threat they faced from traffickers. Instead the final statement highlighted the right of nation states to secure their borders, and set migration targets. Trump also shot down Italian plans on African food security, days after the White House revealed plans to cut American foreign aid by a third. In 2015 the G7 committed to lift 500 million people out of famine and malnutrition, but instead famines have spread in Africa. Friederike R\u00f6der, director at ONE, the aid charity, said: \u201cIn a year of greatly-diminished expectations, the G7 have managed to set a new low. The early promise of this summit was crushed by the Trump administration\u2019s hostile negotiating posture and the evident lack of ambition.\u201d Trump did concede some ground in the final leader\u2019s statement by signing up to a pledge to oppose protectionism. His aides insist he wants free, fair and reciprocal trade. In a win for the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, the statement was expected to repeat a pledge from the Japanese hosted summit in 2016 to respect a rules based multilateral trade system embodied in the WTO. But Trump still intends to target German trade practices and its surplus, a stance resented by Merkel. At the end of the summit, Trump chose to give no closing press conference, presumably to avoid questions on whether he knew of his son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s reported plans to set up a secret communications channel with Russia. Trump instead chose to address US forces stationed in Sicily, reprising the themes of his first foreign trip and making no mention of the climate change dispute. He said simply that he had staged a series of productive meetings with his allies at the G7, but again opened fire on Nato nations for failing to spend enough on defense, claiming contributions were starting to rise in a way they would not but for his election.

The media \u2013 both in Canada and around the world \u2013 was now complicit in boosting what Urback described as the \u201cvanity project\u201d being manufactured by Trudeau and his team. </p> <p>\u201cIf this had been the first time the media got suckered into turning a staged Trudeau photo-op into a story, it would be a little more forgivable,\u201d she said.

Days later, <a href=\"http://www.jjmccullough.com/index.php/2016/04/16/the-north-koreanificiation-of-canadian-political-reporting/\">a Vancouver-based blogger suggested</a> the moment might have been more staged than the media coverage had let on, with Trudeau telling reporters earlier that he hoped someone would ask him about how quantum computing works.

          "bodyText": "He\u2019s tackled quantum physics, photobombed a beach wedding, posed shirtless for selfies with a family hiking in the woods and, most recently, jogged past a group of Canadian teenagers heading to prom. And each time, Justin Trudeau\u2019s actions have earned lavish attention from media outlets in Canada and around the world. But after it was pointed out that the shot of Trudeau breezing past the prom-bound teens was snapped by his official photographer, some Canadians have been asking why the media continues to fall for what seems to be a constant stream of PR stunts. In politics, even the most spontaneous run-ins are carefully set up, noted Robyn Urback, a columnist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cAnd public photobombs by politicians in their Sunday sweats usually involve some sort of prior coordination,\u201d she said. In order to capture the moment that Trudeau jogged past the teens, the Maclean\u2019s reporter Aaron Hutchins wrote this week, the staff photographer would have had to run ahead of a planned route, set up his equipment to carefully frame the desired shot and ensure he was ready to snap when Trudeau came by. \u201cAnd what once appeared like a pleasant coincidence of timing for whomever gets to pose with the prime minister, it\u2019s starting to feel even more like a staged exercise than it was before,\u201d said Hutchins. Still, the encounter between Trudeau and the students went viral, catapulted into social media by headlines splashed around the world. The media \u2013 both in Canada and around the world \u2013 was now complicit in boosting what Urback described as the \u201cvanity project\u201d being manufactured by Trudeau and his team. \u201cIf this had been the first time the media got suckered into turning a staged Trudeau photo-op into a story, it would be a little more forgivable,\u201d she said. But outlets around the world \u2013 including the Guardian \u2013 seemingly have an endless appetite for Trudeau-related photos, whether he is showing off yoga moves, jogging in short shorts alongside Mexico\u2019s Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto or gazing into the camera as a young man, his shirt open. Coverage hit a fever pitch last year after the Canadian leader offered his take on quantum computing. Days later, a Vancouver-based blogger suggested the moment might have been more staged than the media coverage had let on, with Trudeau telling reporters earlier that he hoped someone would ask him about how quantum computing works. A reporter later jokingly referred to this before launching into a more serious question; Trudeau seized on the opportunity. Trudeau is a social media savant, the Toronto writer Jesse Brown wrote in the Guardian last year, and he has used this to position himself as a sunny antidote to the turbulent news spilling out from other parts of the world. \u201cTrudeau is the political equivalent of a YouTube puppy video,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEach week, Trudeau feeds the news cycle a new sharable moment, and our Facebook feeds are overwhelmed with shots of the adorable young statesman cuddling pandas and hugging refugees and getting accidentally photographed in the wild with his top off, twice.\u201d The result is a media frenzy that has at times overshadowed the crucial questions being asking about his government, such as how they can claim to fight climate change while throwing their support behind two pipelines in Canada and Keystone XL or why they signed off on a C$15bn deal to sell weaponised military vehicles to Saudi Arabia despite critics who worry the vehicles will be used by the House of Saud against its own citizens.

The MP Jo Cox was murdered by a rightwing extremist last June.</p> \n  <p>Morrissey cited government immigration policy among his complaints, saying the prime minister would never change her immigration policy in the light of the attacks. It is believed that the bomber named by police, Salman Abedi, was British-born and from Manchester.</p> \n  <p>Morrissey also appeared to suggest that politicians were afraid to refer to Abedi as an Islamist extremist.</p> \n  <p>The claim that politically-correct leaders routinely refuse to mention Islam when referring to terror attacks carried out by people holding a violent interpretation of the religion is common on the far-right. In recent years, many politicians have acknowledged the role of such an ideology once it has been confirmed, while also stressing that it is alien to the vast majority of the religion\u2019s adherents.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn modern Britain everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private,\u201d the singer <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Morrissey/posts/1349891061714098\">wrote on his Facebook page</a>. \u201cPoliticians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims.

We have faced a serious terror threat in our country for many years and the operational response I have just outlined is a proportionate and sensible response to the threat that our security experts judge we face. I ask everybody to be vigilant and to co-operate with and support the police as they go about their important work.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to end by repeating the important message I gave in my statement earlier today. We will take every measure available to us and provide every additional resource we can to the police and the security services as they work to protect the public. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd while we mourn the victims of last night\u2019s appalling attack, we stand defiant. The spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain is far mightier than the sick plots of depraved terrorists, that is why the terrorists will never win and we will prevail.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5924a5b4e4b0662750016e11\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/vikramdodd\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-23T21:16:14.016Z\">10.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Given that a \u201cfurther attack may be imminent\u201d, as Theresa May told the nation tonight, the threat level has been raised to critical. That allows military personnel to be deployed on the streets of Britain to free up armed police resources to hunt down suspects.<br></p> \n  <p>The arrangements are known as military assistance to civil powers. A key driver is that the numbers of police armed officers are limited, and they are best suited to hunt for any other terrorists, where the aim is to arrest if possible and try them in the courts. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5924a4b5e4b0610dfc364936\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-23T21:11:28.154Z\">10.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Theresa May\u2019s statement in full:</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe again discussed the callous and cowardly terrorist attack in Manchester last night and the operational response from the security service, the police and other emergency services. It remains the case that other than the terrorist himself, 22 people were killed in the attack, 59 people remain injured and many of them have life-threatening conditions.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs Greater Manchester Police confirmed earlier today, the perpetrator was Salman Ramadan Abedi, who was born and brought up in Britain and as the emergency services confirmed throughout the day, his victims were innocent children, young people and their families - our thoughts and prayers are with them all.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to re-iterate what I said this morning about the professionalism of the emergency services and the bravery of the people in Manchester. Through their actions, they proved that cowardice will always be defeated by bravery, that evil can be overcome by good and that our values, the liberal, pluralistic values of Britain, will always prevail over the hateful ideology of the terrorists.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe work undertaken throughout the day has revealed that it is a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack. This morning I said that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, the independent organisation responsible for setting the threat level on the basis of the intelligence available, was keeping the threat level under constant review. It has now concluded, on the basis of today\u2019s investigations, that the threat level should be increased for the time being from severe to critical. This means that their assessment is not only that an attack remains highly likely, but that a further attack may be imminent.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The prime minister said Operation Temperer - allowing military personnel to take to the streets - was now in force: \u201cThis means that armed police officers responsible for duties such as guarding key sites will be replaced by members of the armed forces, which will allow the police to significantly increase the number of armed officers on patrol in key locations. You might also see military personnel deployed at certain events such as concerts and sports matches, helping the police to keep the public safe.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>May continued: \u201cIn my statement earlier today, I said that the police and security services needed to investigate whether Abedi was acting alone. Those investigations continue. But the work undertaken throughout the day has revealed it is a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis morning I said that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, the independent organisation responsible for setting the threat level on the basis of the intelligence available, was keeping the threat level under constant review.

The attacks have varied in some aspects but are all clearly part of the same effort by the group to terrorise western European populations, polarise communities and motivate their own supporters. </em></p> \n  <p><em>Experts have long predicted a wave of violence as the group\u2019s strongholds in Syria and Iraq crumble under military pressure. </em></p> \n  <p><em>Those predictions were partly based on the idea of a wave of British, French, Belgian and German veterans of the terrorist group\u2019s war in Iraq and Syria returning to their former homes. It is unclear if that is happening generally, or if this latest attack was executed by such an individual or by someone whose connections with the group are tenuous, or even exist at all. The claim of responsibility provides some clues.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Until recently, Isis claims were seen as credible. The group only claimed attacks that were directly or indirectly linked to it, and it was often careful to indicate through the vocabulary used in its communications whether an attacker had been inspired or directed by the group. </em></p> \n  <p><em>Casualty numbers were often inflated \u2013 here the claim is of 100 \u201ccrusaders\u201d \u2013 but claims of links to the attackers were usually substantiated. Sometimes claims included inaccuracies \u2013 an early message after the November 2015 attacks in Paris included a bombing, which didn\u2019t happen, among the various attacks launched by its cell \u2013 but this seems more due to operational issues than a desire to brag, deny, obfuscate or invent. </em></p> \n  <p><em>More recently, however, the claims have been demonstrably less accurate. Isis claimed responsibility for the truck attack in Nice last year, though no evidence has emerged of any links between the group and the man who murdered more than 80 people in the French city during the 14 July celebrations. </em></p> \n  <p><em>It also claimed responsibility for the Westminster attack in London in March, though again, there is nothing to indicate anyone from the organisation was in touch with Khalid Massood, the extremist who drove a car into pedestrians and stabbed a police officer outside parliament. </em></p> \n  <p><em>Some details of the group\u2019s claim of responsibility for the recent Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e shooting \u2013 by a radicalised, police-hating career criminal \u2013 just before the French election also appeared to be wide of the mark. <br></em></p> \n  <p><em>The Manchester claim has some inaccuracies and gaps: it appears to indicate that several explosive devices were left at the arena rather than a single one being set off by the bomber as a suicide attack; and, unusually, the nom de guerre of the attacker is not given. The former confusion may indicate that a planned operation went awry, with perhaps the bomber setting off the explosives early by accident. The latter omission is harder to explain if Isis was deeply involved in the attack.</em><em><br></em></p> \n  <p><em>In recent years, analysts have looked at the timing of claims. If they were issued quickly \u2013 and included some telling operational detail that would only be known to conspirators \u2013 then that indicated Isis had prior knowledge of the attack. If they were slower and lacked precision then it implied the group was more distant.</em></p> \n  <p><em>In several cases, Isis provided proof of its deep involvement by publishing pre-recorded videos of attackers, though some of these appear to have reached the group only as the attack was under way. We will have to see if this kind of evidence emerges.</em></p> \n  <p><em>What we haven\u2019t had yet is Isis claiming an attack that has absolutely nothing to do with their agenda and ideology, which is important in working out who was responsible for this tragedy. Clearly we will know more when we learn something concrete about the identity of the bomber. </em></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSSmithII/status/866991918558916608\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Islamic State's official statement re <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Manchester?src=hash\">#Manchester</a>, w/ dubious figures re casualties, distributed on Nashir News channels before Amaq report <a href=\"https://t.co/bQ17QSmxw5\">pic.twitter.com/bQ17QSmxw5</a></p>\u2014 Michael S.

Many lives will be lived out, impacted by this tragedy for long years to come.

There is no cause, political or religious, that justifies actions of senseless brutality, anywhere or at any time,\u201d said the moderator Derek Browning.</p> \n  <p>The European Jewish Congress condemned the attack. It \u201cdemonstrates once again that the enemies of civilisation have no boundaries,\u201d Moshe Kantor, the EJC president, said. \u201cThis was a concert attended by mostly young people and children and is a ghastly reminder that terrorism sees all of us as potential targets, regardless of age, religion, nationality or background.\u201d<br><br>Bhai Amrik Singh, the chair of the Sikh Federation UK, said: \u201cThe suicide bomber who mindlessly targeted innocent young people in the Manchester Arena must have been deranged. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI would like to applaud Sikhs living and working in Manchester who immediately came to the support of those caught up in the terror attack.

          "bodyText": "Latest coverage continues on our new live blog: Soldiers are to be deployed on Britain\u2019s streets after the threat level was raised from severe to critical, meaning officials believe another terrorist attack may be imminent. The move came in the wake of the suicide bombing of Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people and injured 59 more. The perpetrator has been identified as Salman Abedi, 22, a Mancunian of Libyan descent. He walked into the lobby of the arena on Monday evening as thousands of people were exiting an Ariana Grande concert, detonating an improvised device that murdered and maimed many. Among those he killed were eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos; Georgina Callander, 18; and John Atkinson, 26. Overnight, the names of two more victims have been revealed: Kelly Brewster, 32, and Olivia Campbell, who was 15. Her mother Charlotte Campbell paid tribute to her \u201cdarling precious gorgeous girl\u201d. Several people remain missing, many of them teenagers, with family and friends continuing to share their names and pictures on social media. In messages posted online, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but this has not been confirmed by officials investigating the blast. There are reports today that Abedi had recently returned from a trip to Libya. A 23-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday morning in south Manchester, and is believed to be Ismael Abedi, the brother of the perpetrator. All parties have suspended campaigning for the 8 June general election. The prime minister, Theresa May, condemned the attack as: appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenceless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives. A vigil held in Manchester\u2019s Albert Square on Tuesday evening drew thousands in solidarity with those killed and wounded. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, whose city faced a series of terrorist attacks in 2015, has sent her condolences to Manchester and urged people to stand firm against terrorism. Hidalgo was one of the first to respond to news of the attack at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday evening, which brought back painful memories of the carnage she saw first-hand at Paris\u2019s Bataclan music hall. She told the Guardian her heart went out to the people of Manchester: First I want to send my affection \u2026 this is such a terrible moment, an attack on youngsters, adolescents out having fun, enjoying themselves. My thoughts go to those parents who have lost children or someone close to them and for whom the physical and psychological consequences are so heavy. Parisians, who have suffered attacks, know the horrors into which the people of Manchester are plunged and know how it helps to have messages of affection and support to enable them to raise their heads, to stand strong and to carry on. We received many messages from all over the world and I can tell you this feeling of solidarity and support really helped. What is also important after such events is also for people to feel secure and protected. The The Empire State Building and the Eiffel tower went dark at midnight, in solidarity with the victims of the Manchester attack. Landmark buildings around the UK and the world also paid tribute, with London\u2019s Wembley stadium lighting up \u201cfor Manchester\u201d and the HSBC building in Hong Kong displaying a sign saying \u201cwe stand with the United Kingdom\u201d. The Brandenburg Gate, Florida\u2019s Orlando Eye and Dubai skyscrapers were turned red, white and blue. The Manchester-born singer Morrissey has hit out at politicians for their reaction to the bombing in his hometown that has killed 22 people and hospitalised 59 more. The former Smiths frontman claimed that politicians are safe from attacks, while the rest of the country is left vulnerable. The MP Jo Cox was murdered by a rightwing extremist last June. Morrissey cited government immigration policy among his complaints, saying the prime minister would never change her immigration policy in the light of the attacks. It is believed that the bomber named by police, Salman Abedi, was British-born and from Manchester. Morrissey also appeared to suggest that politicians were afraid to refer to Abedi as an Islamist extremist. The claim that politically-correct leaders routinely refuse to mention Islam when referring to terror attacks carried out by people holding a violent interpretation of the religion is common on the far-right. In recent years, many politicians have acknowledged the role of such an ideology once it has been confirmed, while also stressing that it is alien to the vast majority of the religion\u2019s adherents. \u201cIn modern Britain everyone seems petrified to officially say what we all say in private,\u201d the singer wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cPoliticians tell us they are unafraid, but they are never the victims. How easy to be unafraid when one is protected from the line of fire. The people have no such protections.\u201d Most of Wednesday\u2019s UK newspaper front pages feature images of those killed or missing after the attack. Some also feature the perpetrator, Salman Abedi, with the Sun showing his picture prominently alongside that of Saffie Rose Roussos, the eight-year-old he murdered. Here\u2019s our roundup of how the press has covered the aftermath: The decision to raise the official threat level to critical and to deploy troops under Operation Temperer, meaning that an attack is expected imminently, is the first time for a decade that it has been set at its highest level. The last time troops under Operation Temperer were deployed was immediately after the terrorist attacks in Brussels last year. But they were only used covertly as backup for the visible armed police presence at railway stations and airports. It means that up to 5,000 armed troops can be deployed at transport hubs and other crowded public places in order to release the armed police for other duties. The threat level has only twice before been raised to critical since the system of official threat levels was introduced in 1 August 2006. It was raised for three days from 10 August 2006 at the time of the transatlantic airliner plot, and on 30 June 2007 when the security services uncovered the plot to bomb a nightclub on London\u2019s Haymarket. This was a plot that culminated in the attack on Glasgow airport. A man has been arrested by counter-terrorism police at Stansted Airport tonight, but the Metropolitan police said it was not connected to the Manchester attack. The 37-year-old man was stopped before boarding a flight to Turkey on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism, according to a Met statement: The man has been taken to a south London police station where he is being detained under the Terrorism Act. Officers are now searching two residential addresses in north London. This arrest is linked to travel to Syria. Olivia Campbell, 15, who has been missing since the blast, has died, her mother has confirmed. The teenager was the subject of a massive social media campaign to find her after she could not be contacted in the wake of the explosion. Her mother Charlotte Campbell spoke to the media yesterday about her desperate attempts to make contact with her daughter: I\u2019m at home phoning everybody: hospitals, police, the centres that the children have been put in. Her dad\u2019s in Manchester looking for her. I\u2019ve got friends looking for her. I\u2019ve got people I don\u2019t even know looking for her, people messaging me, saying we\u2019ve got her photo, looking for her, we\u2019ll get in contact if we see her. And I\u2019m just hearing nothing. Her phone\u2019s dead\u2026 They\u2019ve basically told me to stay put and wait for a phone call. I daren\u2019t leave the house just in case she somehow gets home. In the last hour, Charlotte Campbell confirmed that Olivia had died, in a public Facebook post dedicated to \u201cmy darling precious gorgeous girl\u201d. Greater Manchester police has said the upping of the threat level to critical will aid its ongoing investigation into the attack. In an overnight statement, deputy chief constable Ian Pilling said: This is a fast-moving investigation and we continue to have significant resources in place. Raising the threat level to critical, which has been announced by the prime minister this evening, will support our ongoing investigation. People across Greater Manchester have seen an increased police presence throughout the day and this will continue. They will be seen at key locations across the region. We are continuing to work with the national counter-terrorism policing network and UK intelligence services as part of the response to dealing with the tragic events that took place 24 hours ago. We would ask people to remain vigilant as they have been throughout the day and report anything in confidence to the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789321 or in an emergency 999. People have shown tremendous strength and resilience throughout the day and we need this to continue in the difficult days ahead. Another victim of the Manchester bomb has been named. Kelly Brewster, who was 32, died in the blast, her family confirmed to the Daily Mail. Brewster had attended the Ariana Grande concert with her sister Claire and niece, Hollie Booth. They were both injured in the attack and are being treated in hospital. Friends of Brewster have paid tribute to her on on social media. Her uncle, Paul Dryhurst, earlier described how she had been caught up in the blast: Kelly has shielded Hollie and Claire from the damage. The three were walking out in single file, with Claire in front, Hollie behind her, and Kelly behind her. When the bomb has gone off the impact has broken Claire\u2019s jaw and broken Hollie\u2019s legs. They are both currently in hospital having nuts and bolts removed from all places. There are reports tonight that Salman Abedi, named as the perpetrator of the attack, had visited Libya recently, with some saying he returned to the UK only days before he killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena. The Times reports that he spent time in Libya, citing an unnamed school friend: He went to Libya three weeks ago and came back recently, like days ago. Abedi was British, but his family is from Libya. The Guardian understands that his father, Abu Ismail Abedi, is thought to be in Tripoli. The Sun reports that Salman Abedi may have used trips to Libya to travel to Syria. This has not been confirmed. The Guardian\u2019s Wednesday front page, as with many others, focuses on the lives lost in the attack: A third meeting of the Scottish government\u2019s resilience committee was held late on Tuesday to discuss the implications of raising the UK threat level to its highest \u201ccritical\u201d level, Press Association reports: Police Scotland have increased their presence, including armed officers, at locations such as transport hubs and city centres as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d. The force will review security for all events taking place in Scotland in the next two weeks, including the Scottish cup final at Hampden on Saturday. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: There is no intelligence of an increased risk to Scotland and this remains the case, but we should continue to stay vigilant. Police Scotland are providing support to the families of Laura MacIntyre and Eilidh MacLeod from Barra. Both families have asked for privacy at this difficult time. Our thoughts go out to them and to the families of everyone who has been caught up in this tragedy. Scotland stands together, in solidarity, with the people of Manchester \u2013 we will not be divided by those who seek to destroy our way of life. Laura MacIntyre, 15, is being treated in hospital for serious injuries. Her friend Eilidh MacLeod, 14, is still missing. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog again. Soldiers will be sent on to the streets after the UK threat level was raised from severe to critical, meaning \u201cnot only that an attack remains highly likely but a further attack may be imminent\u201d. You can read our full report on that here. Three of the 22 people killed in the attack have been named: 16-year-old Georgina Callander, 26-year-old John Atkinson and Saffie Rose Roussos, eight. You can read about them here. The attacker has been identified as Salman Abedi, 22. Our report on him and the background police are investigating is here. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has issued a statement on what the critical terror threat means for London: This is one of the first pictures of Manchester suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, taken during an Islamic class at the Didsbury mosque. A much younger Abedi can be seen sat cross-legged, dressed in a camouflage-type jacket and reading the Quran. In London the Cyprus high commission is flying flags at half mast in honour of Saffie Roussos, the British Cypriot who at aged eight has been identified as the youngest victim of the Manchester attack. The Cyprus News Agency reports that Saffie\u2019s relatives, including her father, Andreas, who was born in Cyprus but subsequently moved to Liverpool, is tonight travelling to the UK from the Mediterranean island. Saffie was at the concert with her mother, Lisa, and older sister Ashlee Bromwich, in her twenties, both of whom are now being treated in hospital for injuries. The Cyprus high commissioner, Euripides Evriviades tweeted: \u201cTotal inadequacy of words in expressing massive sympathy to bereaved family. RIP to 8 y/o angel Saffie-Rose Roussos.\u201d Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said the doubt about whether a wider group was involved in the Manchester attack led to the decision to raise the threat level. \u201cThe public would expect the police to do everything possible to prevent further attacks and keep them safe. We are flexing our resources to increase police presence at key sites, such as transport and other crowded places and we are reviewing key events over the coming weeks,\u201d Rowley said. He is the UK\u2019s most senior counter-terrorism officer and hinted that the use of emergency powers had been used for only a short period previously: \u201cCritical is a very unusual and rare step.\u201d Rowley added that there was following the Manchester attack there was now an \u201cintense period of risk\u201d, justifying the special measures that will see \u201cfar more\u201d police officers on the streets. Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, the UK\u2019s most senior anti-terror officer, has also issued a statement tonight: \u201cThe investigation into the terrorist attack in Manchester is large scale, fast moving and making good progress. There has been an arrest and there are currently multiple searches and other activity taking place as I speak. However, at this stage it is still not possible to be certain if there was a wider group involved in the attack; 24 hours in we have a number of investigative leads that we are pursuing to manage the ongoing threat. \u201cThis concern has led to the independent Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre to raise the threat level to \u2018critical\u2019 this evening. It means that their assessment is not only that an attack remains highly likely but a further attack may be imminent. \u201cThe public would expect the police to do everything possible to prevent further attacks and keep them safe. We are flexing our resources to increase police presence at key sites, such as transport and other crowded places and we are reviewing key events over the coming weeks. \u201cAs the prime minister has already said this evening I have asked for support from the military to be deployed alongside the police. This will free up armed officers from certain guarding duties to release our officers to support the wider the response. This is part of an agreed and well-rehearsed plan and military personnel will remain under the command and control of the police service. \u201cAt this time we are asking the public to remain calm but alert. If you see anything that causes you concern, then let us know immediately, if you have suspicions about someone\u2019s behaviour call us. Look out for anything that seems out of place, unusual or doesn\u2019t seem to fit in with day-to-day life. It may be nothing but if you see or hear anything that could be terrorist related trust your instinct no matter how small then act and call 999.\u201d The Guardian understands a national police mobilisation has also been triggered, being run by the National Police Coordination Centre. The centre will find extra officers from around the UK - for example from county forces in mainly rural areas - to be deployed to sites in Manchester, London and other big cities. The decision to raise the terrorist threat level to critical \u2013 the highest \u2013 can lead to extra officers being drafted in to patrol areas assessed as vulnerable to attack, under mutual arrangements between the 43 police in England and Wales. Government guidelines say military help will be provided to \u201cthe civil authorities when their capacity is overwhelmed\u201d. The guidelines updated in 2016, say: \u201cThe armed forces can be brought in to deal with a range of situations including \u2026 after a terrorist attack where armed military personnel may be deployed to locations usually guarded by armed police officers, to enable those officers to undertake other duties.\u201d For instance, armed police officers assigned to guard nuclear plants can be replaced by soldiers, and directly assist their police colleagues in armed operations. The guidelines are in full here. It is now 24 hours since Salman Abedi walked into the Manchester Arena and set off a bomb that killed 22 people and injured 59 more. He targeted a pop concert aimed at teenage girls in particular. The Guardian\u2019s Alexis Petridis writes that such performances are often derided by critics, but the likes of Ariana Grande provide the kind of empowering, transcendent experience that terrorists hate. Theresa May concluded her statement: \u201cI do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed. We have faced a serious terror threat in our country for many years and the operational response I have just outlined is a proportionate and sensible response to the threat that our security experts judge we face. I ask everybody to be vigilant and to co-operate with and support the police as they go about their important work. \u201cI want to end by repeating the important message I gave in my statement earlier today. We will take every measure available to us and provide every additional resource we can to the police and the security services as they work to protect the public. \u201cAnd while we mourn the victims of last night\u2019s appalling attack, we stand defiant. The spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain is far mightier than the sick plots of depraved terrorists, that is why the terrorists will never win and we will prevail.\u201d Given that a \u201cfurther attack may be imminent\u201d, as Theresa May told the nation tonight, the threat level has been raised to critical. That allows military personnel to be deployed on the streets of Britain to free up armed police resources to hunt down suspects. The arrangements are known as military assistance to civil powers. A key driver is that the numbers of police armed officers are limited, and they are best suited to hunt for any other terrorists, where the aim is to arrest if possible and try them in the courts. This is Theresa May\u2019s statement in full: \u201cWe again discussed the callous and cowardly terrorist attack in Manchester last night and the operational response from the security service, the police and other emergency services. It remains the case that other than the terrorist himself, 22 people were killed in the attack, 59 people remain injured and many of them have life-threatening conditions. \u201cAs Greater Manchester Police confirmed earlier today, the perpetrator was Salman Ramadan Abedi, who was born and brought up in Britain and as the emergency services confirmed throughout the day, his victims were innocent children, young people and their families - our thoughts and prayers are with them all. \u201cI want to re-iterate what I said this morning about the professionalism of the emergency services and the bravery of the people in Manchester. Through their actions, they proved that cowardice will always be defeated by bravery, that evil can be overcome by good and that our values, the liberal, pluralistic values of Britain, will always prevail over the hateful ideology of the terrorists.\u201d \u201cThe work undertaken throughout the day has revealed that it is a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack. This morning I said that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, the independent organisation responsible for setting the threat level on the basis of the intelligence available, was keeping the threat level under constant review. It has now concluded, on the basis of today\u2019s investigations, that the threat level should be increased for the time being from severe to critical. This means that their assessment is not only that an attack remains highly likely, but that a further attack may be imminent.\u201d The prime minister said Operation Temperer - allowing military personnel to take to the streets - was now in force: \u201cThis means that armed police officers responsible for duties such as guarding key sites will be replaced by members of the armed forces, which will allow the police to significantly increase the number of armed officers on patrol in key locations. You might also see military personnel deployed at certain events such as concerts and sports matches, helping the police to keep the public safe.\u201d May continued: \u201cIn my statement earlier today, I said that the police and security services needed to investigate whether Abedi was acting alone. Those investigations continue. But the work undertaken throughout the day has revealed it is a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack. \u201cThis morning I said that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, the independent organisation responsible for setting the threat level on the basis of the intelligence available, was keeping the threat level under constant review. It has now concluded, on the basis of today\u2019s investigations, that the threat level should be increased for the time being from severe to critical.\u201d In the summer of 2007 terrorists tried and failed to bomb the Tiger Tiger in London\u2019s West End, and then went to Scotland where they launched a car bomb attack on Glasgow airport. Theresa May will chair another meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee at 9.30am tomorrow, Downing Street said. The threat level is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which sits within MI5. Critical means an attack is expected imminently. Home affairs editor Alan Travis tweets: The UK alert level has been at critical twice before. The first was in 2006 following the exposure of a plot to blow up planes flying across the Atlantic, while the second came the following year in response to a plot targeting a London nightclub. A statement from the Met police about these changes will come later this evening, the prime minister adds. She does not not want the public to be unduly alarmed, May says, but this is a proportionate and appropriate response. \u201cWe stand defiant ... the terrorists will never will, and we will prevail.\u201d May says armed police who usually protect places like parliament will be replaced by members of the armed forces. Theresa May is issuing a statement after the second Cobra meeting of the day. The prime minister confirms that the bomber was a 22-year-old man born and raised in the UK. She praises the emergency services\u2019 response and that \u201cevil can be overcome by good\u201d. May says it is a possibility that others were linked with Abedi. The threat level should be increased to critical for the time being. This is the front page of Wednesday\u2019s MEN: The poet, Tony Walsh - also known as Longfella, delivers a passionate rendition of his poem This Is The Place at the city\u2019s vigil on Tuesday, saying \u201calways remember, never forget. Forever Manchester\u201d. Phil and Kim Dick were caught up in the blast when they went to pick up their daughter and granddaughter from the concert. Their relatives were found safe and well but they described caring for one little girl who had been hurt, as well as the horrendous scenes inside the arena. Speaking to Channel 4 News on Tuesday, Phil also had a message for people who might seek to exploit the atrocity. It\u2019s an absolutely terrible thing and I just pray to God that none of these extremists try and make political capital out of it because the last thing that anybody needs now is any more divisiveness. That\u2019s what terrorists want. What they want to do is they want to divide, they want to try and affect our way of life and, unfortunately, there are people on all parts of the political spectrum [who] want to use these kinds of incidents for their own political ends. And, if they do, they\u2019re not much better than the bombers, I don\u2019t think. You can watch the full interview here. Note: the programme has warned its viewers that the Dicks\u2019 full testimony was graphic and that some people might find it upsetting. The author of a poem that stirred the emotions of mourners at a vigil in Manchester says it was a \u201cprivilege\u201d to read it. Poet Tony Walsh, 51, delivered a version of his poem This Is The Place - an ode to the city of Manchester and its people - to a packed Albert Square. \u201cAs a proud Mancunian, I was worried that I\u2019d find that emotional, particularly when I mentioned my mum, who passed away a while ago,\u201d he says. \u201cIt meant a lot to me. I wanted to do it for Manchester. I didn\u2019t want to crack, because Manchester won\u2019t crack. I felt quite calm actually, when it came to do it. It was a privilege.\u201d The poet, originally from Tameside, said the poem was previously commissioned by a charity called Forever Manchester. \u201cThere was flashes of humour in there because that\u2019s Manchester all the time, and it\u2019s Manchester even in its darkest hours. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to me that the poem is true to Manchester and its people, and we fight through these things with humour, as hard as it is sometimes. That\u2019s the Mancunian way,\u201d he said. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has issued a video statement after attending the vigil in Albert Square. A Labour spokesman said the party\u2019s general election campaign remained suspended until further notice: \u201cEvents planned for tomorrow have been cancelled.\u201d Guardian reporter Steven Morris tweets: The prime minister, Theresa May, is now chairing a second meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee in Whitehall. It is understood that campaigning for the general election will remain suspended on Wednesday. BBC reporter Kathryn Stanczyszyn tweets from Birmingham: A vigil in Birmingham for the Manchester Arena victims has been interrupted after a man apparently armed with a large knife and a baseball bat was detained nearby, Press Association reports. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham tweets: Police are understood to have recovered CCTV video of the bomber walking into Manchester Arena where he detonated a bomb. It shows the explosion was deliberate and caused by a device that it is believed was contained in a bag, a source said. The device is described as homemade and crude. It was stable enough to be transported and exploded with devastating effect. It is believed to have been constructed in Britain. The attacker had an identity document on him, sources said. The man named by police \u2013 Salman Abedi \u2013 was born to parents from Libya who came to Britain to flee the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. One senior security source described the attack involving the acquisition and construction of a bomb as \u201ca gamechanger\u201d that has \u201crocked us backwards\u201d because a successful bomb plot has not occurred in the UK since 2005. There is uncertainty among investigators about whether Abedi built the bomb himself, or had help. GMP\u2019s chief constable, Ian Hopkins, said: \u201cThe priority remains to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.\u201d Family friends of Laura MacIntyre, 15, the schoolgirl from Barra who went missing last night with her close friend Eilidh MacLeod, say she is in hospital with very serious burns. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting confirmation of that ourselves,\u201d said Donald Manford, a local councillor and great uncle of Eilidh. \u201cShe is very seriously injured and ill.\u201d Manford said he had yet to hear any word about Eilidh, 14. \u201cShe\u2019s a very vibrant young person, who\u2019s very involved in the community. When we have ceilidhs, she\u2019s a dancer and a piper,\u201d he said earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s a very anxious time.\u201d Former Manchester United player Eric Cantona tweets: Addressing the crowd at the vigil, GMP\u2019s Ian Hopkins said: \u201cAs your chief constable of Greater Manchester and as a father I cannot begin to imagine how anyone can carry out such an unthinkable act \u2013 murdering 22 people and injuring 59 \u2013 and my thoughts and those of my colleague are very much with their families at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d He continued: \u201cLast night, in the most atrocious circumstances, the people of Greater Manchester showed the world how much we care. How much we care about each other and how much we were prepared to help those in need. And I\u2019ve heard some tremendous stories of doctors coming in to support and police officers, ambulance workers giving up their days off turning up to help those in need.\u201d Senior figures who attended the Manchester event included the home secretary Amber Rudd, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. An appeal set up today by the Manchester Evening News has now raised more than \u00a3500,000. The alert over a suspicious package found at Salford University has turned out to be a false alarm. Manchester City Council and the British Red Cross have launched an appeal for those injured or bereaved by the Manchester attack. The lord mayor of Manchester, Councillor Eddy Newman, said the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund will make payments to help families in need, including those faced with funeral costs and individuals who may have suffered life-limiting injuries. \u201cThe fund has been established after countless people, from Manchester and from around the world, expressed their desire to help,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are incredibly grateful to the huge amount of people reaching out to offer their support.\u201d The British Red Cross have kicked off the appeal with a \u00a350,000 donation. To donate go to www.redcross.org.uk/manchester or call 0300 456 4999. Helen Pidd is at the vigil: There has just been a minute\u2019s silence held at the vigil for the 22 people who were killed last night. Those attending the vigil include the former England cricket captain Freddie Flintoff. Officers raided the house on Elsmore Road, which is the registered address of Salman Abedi. He has now been named as the man believed to be responsible for the arena atrocity. A squad of police are seen carrying out a controlled explosion to blast down the front door of the property off Wilbraham Road in Fallowfield at 11.30am on Tuesday. This video, taken by resident Theo Brown, shows police preparing to go into the property. A number of armed officers are seen waiting for the controlled explosion before raiding the home. Staff and students at Salford University have been told to leave buildings on the campus. However, we have no more detail at this stage and it is not clear why the evacuations are taking place. The former US president tweets: The Guardian\u2019s North of England editor, Helen Pidd, is at the vigil, which officially begins at 6pm. It is understood that Ian Hopkins, the Greater Manchester police chief constable, was involved in high-level meetings with counter-terrorism officials about identifying Salman Abedi until moments before he stepped outside the force headquarters. Hopkins had been due to give an update at 4.30pm, but that was hastily delayed after Abedi was named by the Press Association, which became the first UK news organisation to name the suspected bomber. Hours earlier, the force had warned news organisations that naming any possibly suspect could hamper the ongoing investigation into Monday night\u2019s atrocity. If you want to buy the doctors and nurses at Manchester Royal Infirmary a pint tonight, you have until 6pm to donate to a kitty behind the bar at the Turing Tap, the hospital\u2019s on-site pub. So far more than \u00a31,100 has been pledged to say thank you to the staff who worked through the night to save lives. Alan and Frances Kinsey live opposite the raided house on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield. The first they knew of the raid was when Alan Kinsey tried to leave the house at about 11.30am and was told to go back inside by police. Video he took on his phone from an upstairs window shows about 30 armed police officers surrounding the house and blowing the door open. Alan, 52, says he watched the house following the raid and did not see anybody being taken out. The couple, who have lived in their house for 17 years, say they do not know the family at the address to talk to. The raid came as a horrible shock, they say. They say that for the past six months there has seemed to only be a man in his 20s living in the house, with others occasionally coming and going. Alan described the man as more than 6ft 2ins, slim and usually wearing traditional Islamic dress. Alan says he only communicated with the man once, when they disagreed over parking. This is the full statement read by the GMP chief constable, Ian Hopkins: Can I start by once again passing on our heartfelt sympathies to all the innocent people caught up in last night\u2019s despicable act. We now have a team of specially trained family liaison officers who are supporting families. There has been much speculation and names of those who may have been killed in the media and social media. We accept that this is inevitable, however, we ask that people allow the police and coroner to release the names once the families are ready and appropriately supported. As you would expect the police response to this across Greater Manchester has been significant as we support people to go about their daily business. Part of this response has seen us arrest a 23-year-old man in connection with the attack and we have also carried out two warrants, one in Whalley Range and one in Fallowfield that included a controlled explosion to enable safe entry. We understand that feelings are very raw right now and people are bound to be looking for answers. However, now more than ever, it is vital that our diverse communities in Greater Manchester stand together and do not tolerate hate. We have been visited by the prime minister and home secretary and we have taken them through the emergency response so far and what we plan to do in future days. I can confirm that the man suspected of carrying out last night\u2019s atrocity has been named as 22-year-old Salman Abedi. However, he has not yet been formally identified and I wouldn\u2019t wish, therefore, to comment further. The priority remains to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.\u201d The suicide bomber behind the Manchester terror attack has been named by police as Salman Abedi, 22. Abedi, believed to be from Manchester, was named by the Greater Manchester police chief constable, Ian Hopkins, in a media briefing outside the force\u2019s headquarters on Tuesday afternoon. A garden party at Buckingham Palace has observed a minute\u2019s silence in memory of the victims of the Manchester terror attack. Moments after the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and Princess Eugenie arrived at the event a drum roll signalled the start of the tribute. The minute\u2019s silence was observed just before the playing of the national anthem, which is normally played before garden parties at the palace begin. In a message of support, the Queen said: \u201cThe whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury in Manchester last night of so many people, adults and children, who had just been enjoying a concert. I know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured.\u201d The parents of two schoolgirls from the Hebridean island of Barra \u2013 Laura MacIntyre, 15, and Eilidh MacLeod, 14 \u2013 who remain missing after the concert bombing flew to Manchester on Tuesday to help police find their children. A tweet by Laura\u2019s father Micheal appealing for news of his daughter was retweeted more than 13,000 times: A similar Facebook post by Eilidh\u2019s aunt, Margaret MacNeil, was shared nearly 84,000 times. She wrote: \u201cPlease let us find the girls safe and well.\u201d Angus MacNeil, the MP for the Western Isles and a family friend of the MacIntyres, said police had asked the girls\u2019 parents for a detailed description of their clothing to help find them. The island has a population of just over 1,000, and MacNeil said islanders were feeling extremely tense after such a long time without news. The teenagers, who are pupils at the small community high school in Castlebay, had travelled to the concert with Eilidh\u2019s mother Marion on Sunday, MacNeil said. The girls\u2019 fathers and Laura\u2019s mother had managed to get seats on Tuesday on the only available flight to the mainland from the nearby island of Benbecula after other passengers gave up their places. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, told MSPs at Holyrood that the two girls were still unaccounted for. Police Scotland liaison officers are supporting the family. \u201cIt is hard for any of us to imagine the anguish that their families are going through,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cThey are in our thoughts and the Scottish government and Police Scotland will do all we possibly can to ensure that they have all the support they need.\u201d The three Take That concerts due to take place at the Manchester Arena later this week have been postponed, the venue said this afternoon. Here is Theresa May signing the book of condolence at Manchester town hall. A crowdfunding page set up by the Manchester Evening News has raised more than \u00a3360,000 since being set up and the total continues to rise. By 11.15am, more than 1,700 supporters had donated \u00a328,000, and by about midday the figure hit \u00a350,000. One person who donated left a message that read: \u201cMy heart is with you all. I am deeply saddened by the recent events. I pray you are all OK and for those that have sadly passed away I pray you are safe in heaven.\u201d This is what Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said about the Manchester attack at a news conference. The whole House of Representatives extends its condolences to the families of the victims. Our prayers are especially with those who are still searching for their children. I don\u2019t know \u2013 maybe it\u2019s because I am a father of teenagers, but that is the part that keeps me coming back to this. I mean, think about the kids who had this date on their calendar circled. Think about the kids who got their parents to agree to take them to the concert. Or maybe it was a birthday present, or maybe it was a surprise. Or think about the kids who went to the concert with their friends on the agreement that they would get together and meet their parents outside right after it. Those are the kinds of conversations that go on in families with teenagers. And then all those moms and dads waiting outside when disaster struck \u2013 think about that for a second. Many rushing in, hoping to God and fearing the worst. To deliberately target innocent children is cowardice in its most heinous form. So we should not be surprised that Isis has claimed responsibility for this attack. But we will never bow or bend to radical Islamic terror. In Manchester, we have seen hotels taking in survivors. We have seen local residents offering beds to those who are stranded. We have seen taxi cabs driving back and forth through the night, offering free rides to bring people to safety. And as we speak, people on social media are reaching out to connect families with their loved ones. Terror is a threat that we all face together \u2013 and with our might, and with our humanity too. In that spirit, I want to express solidarity of the whole House of Representatives to prime minister May and her government. We stand ready to help in any way we can. Because freedom, compassion, and peace will always prevail over violence and hate. Downing Street has held a special lobby briefing this afternoon to update journalists on what the government has been doing in relation to the Manchester attack. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not have anything new to say about the police investigation, and most of the points that emerged were process-related. May has spoken on the phone today with the American president Donald Trump, the French president Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni and the Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. All expressed their support for Britain following the attack. Further calls with world leaders are expected later today. She spoke to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, at 4am to discuss the suspension of the election campaign. She was informed about the attack shortly after it happened. She was in Downing Street at the time, and was alerted by officials. She still plans to attend the Nato and G7 summits later this week. At the G7 summit May is due to lead a discussion on counter-terrorism, something planned before last night\u2019s attack. She visited the incident room when she went to Greater Manchester police HQ earlier today to thank staff. She also met the chief constable, Ian Hopkins, the Greater Manchester fire chief Peter O\u2019Reilly, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the council leader Richard Leese. She will chair another Cobra meeting in Downing Street later today. The spokesman refused to say whether the suicide bomber was linked to Islamic extremism, or whether he was known to the authorities. The spokesman said the police were still working on confirming the man\u2019s identity. Residents in Elsmore Road, where police carried out a controlled explosion and raided a home, saw armed police conducting the operation. Tina Ward, 32, says she came out of her home at about midday to see about 30 armed police flooding into the front garden of a neighbouring property. She says the raided house is home to a big Asian family with sons. \u201cThey seem to be quiet,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in my house 10 years and they\u2019ve been there longer than me.\u201d Farazans Kosur lives on Thelwall Avenue, around the corner from the raided house. She says she knew the family in the house, though not very well. She said the family had sons in their 20s and a younger son and daughter. The older sons would wear religious dress and attend a mosque. The mother was a \u201cvery nice woman\u201d and taught Kosur\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter to read the Qur\u2019an. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate the bombing and everybody is scared \u2026 It\u2019s a nice area. We\u2019ve had no problems.\u201d The exams regulator Ofqual has announced that pupils affected by the Manchester bombing may qualify for \u201cspecial consideration\u201d for sitting this summer\u2019s GCSEs, A-levels and other exams. Earlier, Ofqual said it was up to headteachers whether they wanted to postpone exams. In an update it said there were no plans to cancel exams, but pupils affected by the attack would be treated fairly. It said: \u201cWe have met with exam boards today to discuss our collective response to the tragic events in Manchester last night. \u201cWe know some students from schools and colleges sitting GCSEs, AS and A-levels, as well as other vocational and technical qualifications, are likely to have been affected. Today\u2019s exams have gone ahead as planned and there are no plans to cancel or postpone others. \u201cWe recognise that the impact of these events may not be just short term. We will continue to work closely with exam boards over coming days to gauge the impact on individual schools and colleges, and to make sure that special consideration options are considered and applied appropriately and fairly if students have been affected.\u201d Anne Longfield, the children\u2019s commissioner for England, has urged adults to \u201cfind a way to tell our children what has happened\u201d. She said: \u201cIt is difficult to comprehend the brutality of the bombing in Manchester which specifically targeted the most vulnerable group in our society \u2013 children and young people. This horrific and cowardly attack was aimed at an audience for a pop star with a huge young following, a fact that could not have been overlooked by whoever planned such an atrocity. \u201cThis senseless and barbaric act has robbed a group of children (one as young as eight) and teenagers with their lives ahead of them, of their hopes and dreams. For those killed these will never be realised, for those injured they may be irreparably altered. \u201cToday, as adults, we must find a way to tell our children what has happened. To find the courage to help them understand and give them the reassurance and love they need to deal with such terrible news.\u201d James Corden paid tribute to Manchester on CBS\u2019s the Late Late Show on Monday night. \u201cIt\u2019s famous all over the world for so many wonderful things,\u201d the visibly shaken host of the US chat show said. \u201cGreat football teams, Man City. Man United. Incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division. It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it\u2019s the home of the inventor of the first computer. It\u2019s a place full of comedy and curries and character. \u201cBut when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I\u2019m telling you a more tight-knit group of people you will be hard-pressed to find. Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core and, if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff at the MEN Arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency teams, Ariana and her team and all of those families affected by tonight.\u201d Royal Manchester children\u2019s hospital has shared photographs of boxes of food that have been donated by the public and local businesses for NHS staff and families affected. They included crisps, popcorn, drinks and pastries. The hospital tweeted to say: \u201cWe are overwhelmed by gifts \u2026 Thank you.\u201d Relatives of a woman missing in the attack told South West News that victims were left with metal bolts embedded in their bodies. Paul Dryhurst\u2019s niece, Kelly Brewster, 32, is feared to have been killed when she visited the arena with her sister, Claire Booth, and Booth\u2019s daughter, Hollie, 11. All three were caught in the blast and Booth, 34, and Hollie were today being treated in hospital for horrific shrapnel wounds. Speaking from his home in Sheffield, Dryhurst said Booth and Hollie were having bolts surgically removed from their bodies. Dryhurst, a 59-year-old lorry driver, said: \u201cKelly has shielded Hollie and Claire from the damage. \u201cThe three were walking out in single file, with Claire in front, Hollie behind her and Kelly behind her. When the bomb has gone off the impact has broken Claire\u2019s jaw and broken Hollie\u2019s legs. They are both currently in hospital having nuts and bolts removed from all places.\u201d He said his niece, Kelly, was still missing. Dryhurst said \u201cAfter the impact Claire had gone to Hollie, but when she looked up she couldn\u2019t find Kelly. They lost her in all the commotion. Paul added: \u201cWe\u2019ve now not heard anything for so long and holding on to the old saying \u2018no news is good news\u2019, but the longer it goes on, the worse it feels.\u201d Theresa May, has arrived at Manchester\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary to meet victims of the attack and staff. May arrived in a black Jaguar and was escorted into the hospital entrance by royal and specialist protection officers from the Metropolitan police. The prime minister is expected to talk to patients and staff in a visit not expected to last longer than 30 minutes. Twelve children under 16 are being treated at the children\u2019s hospital and nine adults are being treated at the MRI. The former prime minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah have tweeted this. The US director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, has just returned from London, where he said he had spent a lot of time with intelligence colleagues discussing security threats to the UK and US. \u201cIt once again reminds us. This threat is real. It is not going away and needs significant attention to do everything we can do to protect our people,\u201d Coats told a congressional committee. On Islamic State involvement in the Manchester bombing, Coats said the US intelligence community \u201chave not verified, yet, the connection\u201d. This is from Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general. Armed police have arrived at the Etihad stadium, where friends and family of victims are being supported by family liaison officers and British Red Cross staff. Speaking outside the stadium, British Red Cross worker Niall Pemberton said he had been helping the families since 8am, when the first relatives began to arrive. He said: \u201cWe have got a mixture of families in there going through a range of emotions. Different people at different stages of emotion. \u201cWe are there to provide people with the opportunity to offload. We are here because of some of the expertise we have supporting friends and families.\u201d There has been a steady trickle of volunteers bringing food, water and pizza to the stadium throughout the day. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, walked to the British embassy in Paris (it is close to the Elys\u00e9e Palace) to sign the book of condolences for victims of the Manchester attack. Manchester remains jumpy. As doctors and nurses cared for patients at the Manchester Royal Infirmary and Manchester Children\u2019s hospital, a fire alarm forced the evacuation of the hospital. A single fire engine arrived and the staff and patients were able to return shortly after they were evacuated. This is what Theresa May said when asked what would be done to ensure that people and their children going to music concerts and festivals over the summer will be safe. Well, the police and others will of course be looking at the security of venues to ensure that people can continue to enjoy summer events, feeling secure, and enjoy those events. What is clear is that we are ensuring that resources are available for the police in order to be able to do the job that they need to do. This was a horrendous attack, absolutely horrific, barbaric in its nature, but what I\u2019m also clear about is that we will not let the terrorists win. Our values will prevail. The Metropolitan police is reviewing security plans for upcoming events in the capital. Police could be deployed to smaller events that have not been policed in the past, it said. There will also be an increase in armed and unarmed officers on patrols around key locations and crowded places. A full review of the security and policing operations for the weekend\u2019s sporting events at Wembley and Twickenham is also under way. Operation Hercules, involving the deployment of a range of armed officers, will be stepped up. Commander Jane Connors said: \u201cWe are determined to do all we can to protect the capital. That means that over the coming days as you go to a music venue, go shopping, travel to work or head off to the fantastic sporting events you will see more officers, including armed officers. \u201cWe are used to delivering policing operations that seek to mitigate against the severe threat we face from terrorists. It is only right that we now take time to review those existing plans and make sure we are confident that we are doing all we can. \u201cAs you are out and about in London please be alert \u2013 call us immediately if you see something suspicious. If you are at an event and something worries you, go straight to a police officer or security guard and tell them. The BBC is playing a clip of an interview with Theresa May in Manchester. She says an \u201cabsolutely callous\u201d act has taken place. She has spoken to the police about the inquiry. They are working to see if the attacker was part of a wider group. Q: The youngest victim named was eight. May says this is a \u201chorrendous tragedy\u201d. She is ensuring the police have the resources they need. She thanks the police for their work. Officers turned up for work when they were off duty. The terrorists must not prevail. Q: What can you say to people worried if their children will be safe at concerts this summer? May says the police will be looking at events to ensure that people are safe. We must ensure our values prevail, she says. That vigil for the victims will take place between 6pm and 7pm, Manchester police has confirmed. Prince Charles has expressed his deep distress. In a statement, he said: My wife and I were so profoundly shocked to learn of the truly dreadful event which took place in Manchester last night. That such a large number of people, including so many young concert-goers, lost their lives or have suffered so much in this appalling atrocity is deeply distressing and fills us with intense sadness. Words cannot adequately express what so many families must be feeling at this incredibly difficult time and our most heartfelt sympathy is with all those who have so tragically lost loved ones or who have been affected in some way. Residents have gathered at the entrance to Elsmore Road in the suburb of Fallowfield, where police reportedly carried out a controlled explosion at about 12.30 today. Many say they have heard that a man was arrested at gunpoint at this address, but I haven\u2019t found anybody who actually saw it. The road has been blocked off, there is a police helicopter overhead and scores of police officers can be seen outside a property at the end of the street. There is also a fire engine parked nearby. Neville Edwards, who lives locally and whose mother\u2019s house backs on to the property raided by police, said he came to see what was going on after he heard the explosion. He says he doesn\u2019t know the people who live in the house and, although there have been a few names \u201cbandied about\u201d, he isn\u2019t familiar with any of them. \u201cThe explosion rocked windows and my mum said it rocked her house,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were people as far as Platt Lane, which is half a mile away, who felt it.\u201d He says it was \u201cshocking and scary\u201d for people in the area, given what happened last night. Lots of local parents went to pick children up from the local primary school when they heard it, he says. \u201cThere are a lot of families with young children in the area and they need reassuring that it\u2019s under control. \u201cAs you can see it\u2019s a really close-knit area, with really good community links,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cEverybody knows everybody and people would do anything for each other, which makes it even more shocking that this has happened at an address in the area.\u201d Forensic officers were photographed searching an address in Elsmore Road. The British Red Cross has set up a reception centre at the Manchester Etihad stadium for family and friends of those involved in the attack. Niall Pemberton, a senior emergency response officer, is managing four volunteers who are giving support to the families affected. He said the atmosphere inside the stadium was sombre. \u201cPeople are processing the incident, processing their grief, processing their trauma and really going through that array of emotions that would be expected in a situation like this,\u201d he said. Police have asked people to go to the reception centre if they are still awaiting information and want to be reunited with someone who is missing, as well as those coming to terms with the death of someone who was at the concert. \u201cThere\u2019s a real mixture of people,\u201d Pemberton said. He said there were 10- 12 families in the reception centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here since about 8 o\u2019clock this morning. It\u2019s a voluntary response. We\u2019re offering practical and emotional support, what that looks like in practice is helping people come to terms with the situation they\u2019re going through, offering people space, the opportunity to have someone to talk to, or provide refreshments if they\u2019re needed.\u201d The families are helping each other too, he added. \u201cPeople are processing grief and the information they\u2019re hearing in different ways. They\u2019re coming together to offer support. The community of Manchester has also put tremendous effort in offering their support.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs at Holyrood an urgent security review is under way for policing major public events, including this Saturday\u2019s Scottish cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden stadium in Glasgow. In a short statement updating the Scottish parliament on the Manchester Arena attack, the first minister confirmed Police Scotland has significantly increased the deployment of armed officers and armed response vehicles in public places as a precaution. Officers from Police Scotland and the British Transport police were on duty at motorway service stations and train stations to interview any Scottish concert-goers on their way home who could be witnesses to the attack, she said. Sturgeon added that two teenagers from the small Hebridean island of Barra who had attended the Ariana Grande concert, Laura MacIntyre 15, and Eilidh MacLeod, 14, were still missing, 14 hours after the attack. So far, four Scottish injured victims had been identified, with two already discharged from hospital and a third expected to be released later today. She and Ken Macintosh, Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer, said they had written separately to the mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, sharing their condolences. Macintosh said: There is a tangible sense of shock and sorrow in parliament as we come together today and reflect on the events of last night in Manchester. The fact that those deliberately targeted in the attack were innocent children and young people who had come together to enjoy a concert makes the news all the more devastating. Polish citizens are among those missing after the attack, the Polish foreign ministry has confirmed to Jakub Krupa from the Polish Press Agency. He says Angelika and Marcin Klis are reported missing. The RMT has suspended a planned strike next week on Merseyrail, Northern Rail and Southern Rail in the wake of the Manchester attack. Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cIn light of the horrific bombing in Manchester last night, and the heightened safety and security alerts on our transport services, RMT\u2019s executive has taken the decision to suspend the 24 hours of strike action scheduled for Tuesday 30 May on Merseyrail, Northern Rail and Southern Rail. \u201cOur thoughts and solidarity at this time are with the people of Manchester.\u201d It seems that the controlled explosion in Fallowfield occurred on Elsmore Road. The Press Association has this: Armed police sealed off Elsmore Road this morning as residents heard a large bang in the street. Rosemary Ward, 21, said: \u201cThey were all running out of the house when a big bomb went off. That\u2019s obviously what it was because the whole house was shaking. Everyone was panicking. I heard there was 20 people in that one house. It was scary.\u201d She said: \u201cI\u2019m shaking. I\u2019m just worried about my child.\u201d Ward added: \u201cIt was the bang that shook us up. I started crying and just picked my child up.\u201d She said the police operation was at about 11.30am. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, arrived at Royal Manchester Children\u2019s hospital on Tuesday afternoon but declined to comment as he rushed into the building. Twelve children under the age of 16 were among the 59 casualties taken to hospitals in the city, medical staff told reporters outside the Manchester Royal infirmary. David Ratcliffe, the medical director of the North West ambulance service, said 12 patients were taken by ambulance to the children\u2019s Hospital. Nine were taken to the neighbouring infirmary. Others were taken to hospitals across Greater Manchester. In a statement, Jon Rouse, the chief officer of Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, expressed \u201cdeep condolences\u201d to the victims and their families. \u201cIt\u2019s been a terrible night and morning in terms of Greater Manchester,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we have also seen some of the best aspects of Greater Manchester and the people who live there as well.\u201d Dozens of cameras and reporters are assembled outside the infirmary in an otherwise calm atmosphere. Rouse added: \u201cClearly there are a number of individuals who have very, very serious injuries and are requiring intensive care and people who are going to be in hospital for a long time in terms of that treatment.\u201d Ratcliffe said: \u201cWe sent 60 vehicles to the site, along with highly specialised crews, highly specialised teams, that were able to stabilise patients at the scene and ensure that they received the right treatment at the scene before evacuation to hospital. We took 59 patients to local A&amp;Es around the Greater Manchester area.\u201d He said nine patients had been taken to the infirmary, six to Salford Royal Foundation Trust, six to the University Hospital of South Manchester, six to Stepping Hill, eight to Bolton hospital, seven to the Royal Oldham hospital and five to North Manchester hospital. The Isis claim of responsibility (see earlier) was expected by most analysts given the timing, type and target of the Manchester bombing It obviously comes after a series of attacks executed by Isis networks or sympathisers (or both) across Europe, including the UK. The attacks have varied in some aspects but are all clearly part of the same effort by the group to terrorise western European populations, polarise communities and motivate their own supporters. Experts have long predicted a wave of violence as the group\u2019s strongholds in Syria and Iraq crumble under military pressure. Those predictions were partly based on the idea of a wave of British, French, Belgian and German veterans of the terrorist group\u2019s war in Iraq and Syria returning to their former homes. It is unclear if that is happening generally, or if this latest attack was executed by such an individual or by someone whose connections with the group are tenuous, or even exist at all. The claim of responsibility provides some clues. Until recently, Isis claims were seen as credible. The group only claimed attacks that were directly or indirectly linked to it, and it was often careful to indicate through the vocabulary used in its communications whether an attacker had been inspired or directed by the group. Casualty numbers were often inflated \u2013 here the claim is of 100 \u201ccrusaders\u201d \u2013 but claims of links to the attackers were usually substantiated. Sometimes claims included inaccuracies \u2013 an early message after the November 2015 attacks in Paris included a bombing, which didn\u2019t happen, among the various attacks launched by its cell \u2013 but this seems more due to operational issues than a desire to brag, deny, obfuscate or invent. More recently, however, the claims have been demonstrably less accurate. Isis claimed responsibility for the truck attack in Nice last year, though no evidence has emerged of any links between the group and the man who murdered more than 80 people in the French city during the 14 July celebrations. It also claimed responsibility for the Westminster attack in London in March, though again, there is nothing to indicate anyone from the organisation was in touch with Khalid Massood, the extremist who drove a car into pedestrians and stabbed a police officer outside parliament. Some details of the group\u2019s claim of responsibility for the recent Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9e shooting \u2013 by a radicalised, police-hating career criminal \u2013 just before the French election also appeared to be wide of the mark. The Manchester claim has some inaccuracies and gaps: it appears to indicate that several explosive devices were left at the arena rather than a single one being set off by the bomber as a suicide attack; and, unusually, the nom de guerre of the attacker is not given. The former confusion may indicate that a planned operation went awry, with perhaps the bomber setting off the explosives early by accident. The latter omission is harder to explain if Isis was deeply involved in the attack. In recent years, analysts have looked at the timing of claims. If they were issued quickly \u2013 and included some telling operational detail that would only be known to conspirators \u2013 then that indicated Isis had prior knowledge of the attack. If they were slower and lacked precision then it implied the group was more distant. In several cases, Isis provided proof of its deep involvement by publishing pre-recorded videos of attackers, though some of these appear to have reached the group only as the attack was under way. We will have to see if this kind of evidence emerges. What we haven\u2019t had yet is Isis claiming an attack that has absolutely nothing to do with their agenda and ideology, which is important in working out who was responsible for this tragedy. Clearly we will know more when we learn something concrete about the identity of the bomber. A witness in Wilbraham Road, south-west Manchester, has confirmed that an arrest took place there this morning. Bob Down, who works at a PR agency above the Elektric Club in the road, said: \u201cThere were police in a couple of cars and I saw them with one guy putting him into the back of a police van. it was quite low key. They guy looked quite young.\u201d We cannot confirm reports that this was the 23-year-old arrested by Manchester police. Theresa May and Amber Rudd, the home secretary, have arrived at the Greater Manchester police HQ. Manchester police have conducted a controlled explosion. In a brief statement the force said: Police have executed warrants, one in Whalley Range, and one in Fallowfield, where a controlled explosion took place, as part of the investigation into last night\u2019s horrific attack at the Manchester Arena. Journalist Ed Caesar, who has written for the Sunday Times and the New Yorker, tweets a picture of the man he claims is the 23-year-old who was arrested by police this morning near his home. This cannot be verified. The location of the photograph is Wilbraham Road in Chorlton-cum-Hardy. David Semple, the chairman of the Manchester Conservative Federation, said he had heard rumours that the suicide bomber may have lived in the flats in Whalley Range being raided by the police. He said: We saw loads of police cars coming down the street and just followed them. Can\u2019t believe it really. We heard he could be from here but not 100%. They are signing everyone out of the apartments now \u2013 it all feels very strange. Armed police remained at the scene and the gates to the complex remained locked. A mother and her newborn baby were allowed to leave the complex and she was met by her relatives but no one else has been allowed to leave. Hassan Swn, 26, a Palestinian student, said police were not allowing residents to collect their cars. The project management graduate, said: I had a job interview but can\u2019t go because they won\u2019t let me get my car. They said something serious is happening but we don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going on. Robert Booth has been speaking to a witness of today\u2019s raid in south Manchester. Neil Labrow, a resident of the Royston Court apartment complex in Whalley Range, where armed police were engaged in a raid at lunchtime, said he didn\u2019t want to leave his flat while the police operation was under way. He said in a phone call that residents had been told by police that they could leave, but they would not be able to return to their homes until further notice. From his window he said he could see three officers in helmets, carrying guns \u201clike you see them using at the airport\u201d. He said the activity appeared to be focused on a recently built block of mostly two-bedroom apartments. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a turnover of population so you don\u2019t get to know people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are quite a few Asian families, many students that bring their families over. It was a rough area but over the years it has got much better and there\u2019s not much trouble.\u201d Twelve children under the age of 16 were among the 59 casualties taken to hospital after the attack, according to David Ratcliffe, the medical director of North West ambulance service. More on Islamic State\u2019s claim of responsibility for the attack. \u201cA soldier of the Caliphate managed to place explosive devises in the midst of gatherings of the Crusaders in the British City of Manchester,\u201d its news service said. Here is the White House read-out of President Trump\u2019s phone call with Theresa May. President Donald J Trump spoke this morning from Jerusalem with prime minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom about the apparent terrorist act in Manchester, England. The two leaders agreed that this attack \u2013 which targeted teenage children and their friends at a joyous event \u2013 was particularly wanton and depraved. The president reassured the prime minister that Americans stand with the people of the United Kingdom and that our resolve will never waiver in the face of terrorism. He offered American aid in the United Kingdom\u2019s investigation and vowed to continue the mutual fight against terrorism. Both leaders commended the courage, speed and professionalism of those who responded to the wounded, secured the innocent, and tended to the survivors and their families. The president said he looks forward to seeing prime minister May in person this week and discussing America\u2019s unbreakable commitment to the United Kingdom and the ways both countries can work with allies and partners around the world to defeat terrorism. May and Trump are due to meet later this week at a G7 meeting in Sicily. A \u201cbeautiful little girl\u201d has been named as a victim of the suspected suicide attack after the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester that has left at least 22 dead and 59 people injured. Saffie Rose Roussos, eight, was at the concert with her mother, Lisa, and sister Ashlee Bromwich, who were later found injured in separate hospitals. Chris Upton, the headteacher at Tarleton Community primary school, where Saffie was a pupil said: Saffie was simply a beautiful little girl in every aspect of the word. She was loved by everyone and her warmth and kindness will be remembered fondly. Saffie was quiet and unassuming with a creative flair. The news of her death had come as a \u201ctremendous shock\u201d, he added. \u201cThe thought that anyone could go out to a concert and not come home is heartbreaking.\u201d The tight-knit school would be helping staff and pupils to cope with the shocking news, he said. Saffie was at the concert with her mother Lisa and her sister Ash. It is understood Lisa and Ash are being treated in hospital What we know so far about the attack: At least 22 people, including children, have been killed and 59 injured in a suicide bombing at a crowded pop concert in Manchester, the most deadly attack in Britain in a decade. The horror unfolded at about 10.30pm on Monday at the end of a concert by the American singer Ariana Grande, whose music is popular with children and teenagers. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to an unverified report by Reuters. Greater Manchester police say the perpetrator was a man acting alone, who died at the scene after detonating an improvised explosive device. Manchester police have confirmed the arrest of a 23-year-old in connection with last night\u2019s attack. Officers in riot gear with guns have also raided a flat on the Whalley Range/Chorlton border. Investigators are trying to establish whether the bomber was part of a wider network. Manchester\u2019s Arndale shopping centre was evacuated after a security alert as the atmosphere in the city remains tense. Manchester police confirmed that a man was arrested in the centre in an operation thought to be unrelated to the attack. Some of the first victims have been been named. Runshaw College, where 18-year-old Georgina Callander was a student, released a statement, saying: \u201cIt is with enormous sadness that it appears that one of the people who lost their lives in Monday\u2019s Manchester attack was one of our students.\u201d It was also confirmed that eight-year-old Saffie Roussos was killed in that attack. A large area around the Manchester arena has been cordoned off. Victoria station has been closed and train services cancelled for the whole of Tuesday. Police have asked people to stay away from the area. Extra police have been deployed in many cities including London. The British Transport Police said extra officers, some armed, would be on patrol today. A vigil for the victims will be held in Manchester centre tonight. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: \u201cThere is a need for the city, and the city region, to come together, so we are making arrangements for a vigil.\u201d Reaction: Theresa May condemned the attack as \u201csickening\u201d. Speaking outside Downing Street after charing an emergency Cobra meeting, she said :\u201cAll acts of terrorism are cowardly attacks on innocent people, but this attack stands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenceless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives.\u201d May will travel to Manchester later on Tuesday. The Queen has expressed her \u201cdeepest sympathy\u201d to all those affected. She added that \u201cthe whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury\u201d. Campaigning for June\u2019s general election has been suspended. Party leaders Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Tim Farron, Leanne Wood and Paul Nuttall also expressed condolences. Donald Trump, has condemned the \u201cevil losers\u201d behind the attack. \u201cThis wicked ideology must be obliterated \u2013 and I mean completely obliterated \u2013 and the innocent life must be protected. Leaders from across the globe have expressed solidarity with the UK. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany stands \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with the UK. Columnist Katie Hopkins has been reported to police for a tweet in which she called for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d following the terror attack at Manchester Arena. She later deleted the tweet. Faith leaders and community organisations across the UK have condemned the attack. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said \u201cdark evil\u201d cannot overcome \u201cHeroic Mancheste\u201d. Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThis is horrific, this is criminal. May the perpetrators face the full weight of justice both in this life and the next.\u201d Ariana Grande, who was not hurt in the explosion, tweeted that she was \u201cbroken\u201d by the attack. \u201cI am so so sorry. I don\u2019t have words,\u201d she said. President Trump has tweeted this. Mr Hamed, who runs the Q2 management company which maintains the buildings in Whalley Range area of Manchester where a police raid is taking place (see 12.40pm and 12.56pm), says a flat at the back end of the complex was raided close to the Spire hospital. He was called to the building by a relative who lives in the flats. He said: My daughter-in-law lives here and she rang me to say that police are here. All the people living here are families. I can\u2019t believe that. I did not know them personally but have a good number coming from outside the UK, like students, but we don\u2019t have any people living on their own. It is not good news. We have students from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Libya and then families from Manchester. They are two-bed flats. They are from every race. All entry points to the road have been cordoned off and residents are being held back by officers. It is understood the man who detonated the bomb lived in one of the flats at Royston Court in Carlton Road being raided by the police. Residents said the flats were built two years ago and are mainly occupied by refugees. This is from the BBC\u2019s home affairs correspondent, Tom Symonds, on Islamic State claiming responsibility for the Manchester attack. And this is from Gordon Corera, the BBC\u2019s security correspondent. According to Reuters, Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack. This cannot be independently verified. Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, has said the American authorities are \u201cworking closely\u201d with the British authorities to help them investigate the attack. STV has postponed its live televised Scottish leaders\u2019 debate scheduled for Wednesday evening after the Manchester Arena bombing, with the parties preparing to suspend campaigning for much of this week. The debate, due to be broadcast from the Tramway arts centre in Glasgow, was to include Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, Ruth Davidson, of the Scottish Tories, Kezia Dugdale, of Scottish Labour, and Willie Rennie, of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. STV said: \u201cIn light of events in Manchester and the suspension of general election campaigning, STV has taken the decision to postpone its Scottish party leaders\u2019 debate planned for Wednesday evening.\u201d Officers in riot gear with guns have raided a flat in Whalley Range in Manchester. More than a dozen officers in unmarked cars and police vans raided a flat at Royston Court in Carlton Road at about 12.20pm. The public were told to keep out of the way as the officers made their way to the flat on the tree-lined street. A large police presence remains in the area. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has confirmed police are in contact with the families of two Scottish teenagers who are missing after attending the concert in Manchester targeted in a terror attack. Speaking at St Andrew\u2019s House in Edinburgh after a meeting of the Scottish government\u2019s resilience committee, Sturgeon described the attack as a \u201cdreadful atrocity\u201d. She also said that four people had attended hospitals in Scotland after the bomb attack. Two of them have already been discharged, she said. The director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, has condemned the terrorist attack in Manchester as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and said the security service remains \u201crelentlessly focused, in numerous current operations, on doing all we can to combat the scourge of terrorism and keep the country safe\u201d. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has condemned the attack. Speaking during his meeting with President Trump, Abbas said: Allow me at the beginning to condemn the horrible terrorist attack that occurred in the British city of Manchester \u2026 I do offer my warm condolences to the prime minister of Britain, families of victims and the British people. The Queen has spoken of her shock. In a statement, she also thanked the emergency services and expressed admiration for the response of people in Manchester. The whole nation has been shocked by the death and injury in Manchester last night of so many people, adults and children, who had just been enjoying a concert. I know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured. I want to thank all the members of the emergency services who have responded with such professionalism and care. And I would like to express my admiration for the way the people of Manchester have responded, with humanity and compassion, to this act of barbarity. The first victim of the attack has been named as Georgina Callander, 18. Runshaw College, where Callander was a student, released a statement, saying: \u201cIt is with enormous sadness that it appears that one of the people who lost their lives in Monday\u2019s Manchester attack was one of our students here at Runshaw College [\u2026] \u201cOur deepest sympathies, thoughts and prayers go out to all of Georgina\u2019s friends, family and all of those affected by this loss.\u201d Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, told Sky News that his children knew friends who had been at the concert. While terrorist attacks had happened before, this was \u201cof a different order\u201d, Farron said: This a terrorist attack deliberately targeted at children having the time of their lives. It was cowardly, it was deliberate, it is beyond wicked. And that is why it is right that we should determine justice should be done, and we continue to stand up to those who wish to harm our society, to take away life, and to take away our liberty. It was important that people remain \u201cutterly resolute and defiant\u201d, and not change their way of life in response to the attack, he added. Farron said the Lib Dems, Labour and Conservatives had been in touch over the suspension of the election campaign. We are absolutely of the view that our national campaigns have been suspended today. What happens in the future, that\u2019s something to be discussed. The mother of a 19-year-old Manchester Metropolitan University student who was at the Ariana Grande concert describes hearing screaming and \u201ctotal panic\u201d during a phone conversation she had with him minutes after the attack. Her son, who wishes to remain anonymous, used his mobile phone to contact his mother soon after leaving the concert hall. He was seated high up in the stadium and says it was extremely difficult to exit due to people pushing from behind, crushing in the stairways and the crowd surging towards the exit doors. \u201cMy son and his friend rang seconds after they got out. People thought there were gunmen behind them, and they didn\u2019t know which way to go. They were just kids trying to work it out. They didn\u2019t have any help,\u201d his mother said. She said her son asked for advice about where he should go because there was no support at the venue. Police were running the other way, he told her. She said she felt helpless as there was no information online. \u201cI was terrified for him. They wanted to run to the Arndale Centre \u2013 which was the site of a bomb attack when I was a teenager \u2013 of course I knew this might be a bad idea, but they didn\u2019t. They genuinely didn\u2019t know. They are young, but there were much younger children there,\u201d she said. She said although her son had water taken off him, his bags were not searched and security did not check what he was carrying. The Arndale centre is being reopened after being evacuated as police confirm that a man was arrested in the shopping centre in a move currently thought to be unrelated to last night\u2019s attack. Emma Dixon, who works in Yours Clothing in the Arndale centre, said the first she heard of the evacuation was the centre\u2019s security staff walking quickly in one direction. She and her colleagues tried to stay calm, but then saw customers screaming and running for the exit. \u201cAt that point we just ran. We were very frightened,\u201d shesaid. Dixon parked three miles away at a colleague\u2019s house before walking in to work. \u201cWe get here, red-faced, and then we have to leave again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t frightened coming in at all. I was apprehensive about what the atmosphere was going to be like and I knew we wouldn\u2019t be busy, but it was like, \u2018We\u2019re coming in\u2019.\u201d The BBC is postponing the Andrew Neil election interviews planned for this week while election campaigning has been suspended. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been giving his reaction to the Manchester attack, and said he had talked to Theresa May. He also spoke of the need to support the young people who were traumatised by the attack. When asked for his message to the families affected, Corbyn said: I\u2019m terribly sorry and terribly sad for you. There can be nothing worse than losing a child in a situation like this. We have to put our arms around them and support them, not just today but in all the very difficult days to come because a trauma like this doesn\u2019t go in a day or two \u2013 it\u2019s there with them for the rest of their lives. We have to give them all the support we possibly can, and also make sure we live in a safe environment in the future and we live in safety together, but we do not allow communities to be divided by this kind of appalling, atrocious act of violence. Manchester police have confirmed the arrest of a 23-year-old in connection with last night\u2019s attack. Another man was arrested in the Arndale Centre, but this is not currently believed to be connected to last night\u2019s attack. A 23-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the Manchester bomb attack, Greater Manchester police said. Here are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s statement. May condemned the attack in the strongest terms possible, saying that it stood out for its \u201cappalling, sickening cowardice\u201d. It is now beyond doubt that the people of Manchester and of this country have fallen victim to a callous terrorist attack, an attack that targeted some of the youngest people in our society, with cold calculation. This was among the worst terrorist incidents we have ever experienced in the United Kingdom. And, although it is not the first time Manchester has suffered in this way, it is the worst attack the city has experienced and the worst ever to hit the north of England ... The explosion coincided with the conclusion of a pop concert, which was attended by many young families and groups of children. All acts of terrorism are cowardly attacks on innocent people but this attacks stands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenceless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives \u2026 We struggle to comprehend the warped and twisted mind that sees a room packed with young children not as a scene to cherish but as an opportunity for carnage. She said terrorists would never win and the spirit of Manchester and Britain would not be broken. Concluding her statement, she said: At terrible moments like these it is customary for leaders, politicians and others to condemn the perpetrators and declare that the terrorists will not win. But the fact that we have been here before, and the fact that we need to say this again, does not make it any less true. For, as so often while we experience the worst of humanity in Manchester last night, we also saw the best. The cowardice of the attacker met the bravery of the emergency services and the people of Manchester. The attempt to divide us met countless acts of kindness that brought people closer together. And in the days ahead those must be the things we remember. The images we hold in our minds should not be those of senseless slaughter, but the ordinary men and women who put concerns about their own safety to one side and rushed to help, of the men and women of the emergency services who worked tirelessly to bring comfort, to help and to save lives, of the messages of solidarity and hope of all those who opened their homes to the victims. For they are the images that embody the spirit of Manchester and the spirit of Britain, a spirit that through years of conflict and terrorism has never been broken and will never be broken. There will be difficult days ahead. We offer our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of those affected, we offer our full support to the authorities, to the emergency and security services as they go about their workand we all, every single one of us, stand with the people of Manchester at this terrible time. And today, let us remember those who died and let us celebrate those who helped, safe in the knowledge that the terrorists will never win and our country, our values and our way of life will always prevail. She said that a single terrorist had detonated at bomb near one of the exits to the Manchester Arena, \u201cdeliberately choosing the time and place to cause maximum carnage and to kill and injure indiscriminately\u201d. She said that 22 people had died, as well as the attacker, and that 59 people were injured, many of whom have life-threatening injuries. We know that among those killed and injured were many children and young people. She said police thought the attack had been carried out by one man but that they wanted to establish if he was working alone, or if he was part of a wider group. It would take some time to establish the facts, she said. She said police and the security services thought they knew the identity of the attacker, but that at this stage they could not confirm his name. She praised the emergency services for their work last night. About 400 police officers were involved in the operation, she said. And many paramedics, doctors, and nurses have worked valiantly amid traumatic and terrible scenes to save lives and care for the wounded. She said the police and the security services would get all the resources they needed for the investigation. She said the UK threat level remains at \u201csevere\u201d, meaning a terrorist attack is highly likely, and that it would continue to be assessed. She said there was a large cordon around Manchester Arena and Victoria station, which would remain in place for some time. She confirmed she would be going to Manchester to meet the chief constable, the mayor and the emergency services. She said she would chair another Cobra meeting later today. Ambulance crews took 59 casualties to eight different Manchester hospitals and helped about 60 \u201cwalking wounded\u201d, the North West ambulance service has said. Sixty ambulances and a host of NHS staff specially trained to deal with major incidents attended what the NWAS chief executive, Derek Cartwright, described as \u201cthe horrifying scene\u201d of the attack. Cartwright said: \u201cWe were made aware of the incident at 10.46pm and soon after declared a major incident. Our staff worked tirelessly throughout the night to coordinate the large scale response, with 60 ambulances attending the horrifying scene in the city. Ambulance crews were accompanied by our hazardous area response teams, consultant paramedics, advanced paramedics and doctors who all offered their advanced clinical skills. We are extremely proud of the professional way our staff responded and treated those involved. \u201cIn total, our clinicians treated and took 59 patients to hospital \u2013 nine to Manchester Royal Infirmary, six to Salford, six to Wythenshawe, 12 to Manchester children\u2019s, six to Stepping Hill, eight to Royal Bolton, seven to Royal Oldham and five to North Manchester. Approximately 60 \u2018walking wounded\u2019 were also treated by our crews, but did not go to hospital. \u201cNo matter how much we train our staff for incidents such as this, nothing can prepare you for the shock and sadness when tragedies like this occur. This is, indeed, a very sad time for Manchester.\u201d He praised NHS colleagues in other parts of England and Wales for providing \u201cmutual\u201d aid to help relieve the pressure on a very overstretched NWAS. \u201cWe would like to convey our thanks to our colleagues in West Midlands, Wales, Yorkshire and East Midlands ambulance services who provided mutual aid so we could continue reaching patients who needed our help in our communities\u201d, Cartwright added. A homeless man who rushed into the Manchester Arena to help victims of the attack has told of the moment a woman died in his arms after she was injured in the blast. Chris Parker, 33, was begging in the foyer of the venue when the bomb went off, killing 22 people and injuring another 59. He told the Press Association: \u201cEveryone was piling out, all happy and everything else. As people were coming out of the glass doors I heard a bang and within a split second I saw a white flash, then smoke and then I heard screaming. \u201cIt knocked me to the floor and then I got up and instead of running away my gut instinct was to run back and try and help. \u201cThere was people lying on the floor everywhere. \u201cI saw a little girl. I wrapped her in one of the merchandise T-shirts and I said, \u2018Where is your mum and daddy?\u2019 She said, \u2018My dad is at work, my mum is up there.\u2019\u201d Parker said he thought the girl\u2019s mother had died from her injuries. He also said he had tended to a woman in her 60s with serious leg and head injuries. \u201cShe passed away in my arms,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was in her 60s and she had been with her family. I haven\u2019t stopped crying. The most shocking part of it is that it was a kids\u2019 concert.\u201d Parker has slept rough in Manchester for about a year, PA reports. Meanwhile, residents across the city have opened up their homes and offered help to those affected by the attack, using the hashtag #RoomForManchester on social media. The Arndale Centre in Manchester has been evacuated after a security alert as the atmosphere in the city remains tense. Human Appeal, Britain\u2019s leading Muslim charity, has launched an appeal to raise money for the victims of the Manchester attack and their families Muslims for Manchester was launched on Tuesday morning by the charity, which is based in the city. Othman Moqbel, Human Appeal\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAs a Muslim, as a Mancunian and as a father, I want the victims and their families of Monday night\u2019s attack to know that my prayers, the prayers of everyone at Human Appeal and the prayers of Manchester\u2019s Muslim community, are with them. Although the details are currently unclear, this appears to be a despicable and abhorrent attack targeting innocent members of our community. \u201cManchester\u2019s Muslim community stands united with everyone in the city \u2026 Once again my prayers and love go to the victims, their families and this great city.\u201d Jonathan Arkush, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to all those caught up in the Manchester Arena attack at the Ariana Grande concert last night. This savage attack on young people will require a response, but we will not hand victory to the attacker by allowing ourselves to become divided. The response by people of all communities in Manchester, offering shelter and transport to each other, shows our society\u2019s resilience, and that terrorism will not win.\u201d The attack was incomprehensible, said Gershon Silins, the rabbi for the Manchester Liberal Jewish Community. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to many of us that such an atrocity could be carried out at a concert attended by children and young teenagers. A place usually filled with joy and excitement. And as we wake up today to the news that dozens upon dozens of young lives have been prematurely lost and many more changed significantly, the horror of the situation is incomprehensible. For so many families, today is just the beginning of mourning for lives lost, or a new reality of family members irrevocably damaged. \u201cBut as the stories come in of the emergency service teams working tirelessly at the scene, of the local families and businesses opening their doors, we are reminded that it is precisely at times like these that our bond as a community is strengthened \u2013 not diminished. Today we stand side by side in the wake of this atrocity. In support of the bereaved and the injured. Today we all stand together.\u201d The blood bank on Norfolk Street in Manchester city centre has had to start turning people away because it has had so many people come to donate. Karen Hodgins, a nurse at the centre, said they had a queue of about 70 people earlier this morning and were asking people to make appointments online for another time, unless they have the blood group O negative. \u201cMost people are not the blood group that we need, which is O negative, the universal blood type. It\u2019s not rare but it can go to anybody,\u201d she said. She urged people who were O negative to go to a blood bank, but said everybody who already had an appointment would be seen today. Waiting outside the centre, Adam Sharp, 25, said he had come along with his colleagues to \u201ctry and do my bit\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve registered before but have never donated,\u201d he said. He\u2019s was not sure what his blood group is. Standing nearby is Jules Boyle, 24, and about 11 colleagues. She woke up this morning to the news of the bombing. \u201cI\u2019ve never given blood before so I thought it was an appropriate time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty horrific and it\u2019s quite eerie around here today, compared to the normal hustle and bustle,\u201d says Boyle. It didn\u2019t cross her mind not to come into work, she says. \u201cYou need to try and get on with your day and do your bit.\u201d Katie Hopkins has been reported to police for a tweet in which she called for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d following the terror attack at Manchester Arena. Hopkins, a columnist for Mail Online and presenter on LBC radio, quickly deleted the tweet and posted an altered version after widespread condemnation for directly echoing the Nazi term for the Holocaust as part of a longer anti-Muslim tirade. The tweet was directed at Good Morning Britain host Phillip Schofield, who walked across Westminster Bridge in \u201cdefiance\u201d following the attack on parliament earlier this year. It read: \u201c22 dead \u2013 number rising. Schofield. Don\u2019t you even dare. Do not be part of the problem. We need a final solution. #Machester (sic)\u201d. Critics have called for Hopkins to be fired and she has been reported to police. The altered tweet was changed to \u201cwe need a true solution\u201d, but Hopkins said she rewrote it because of a typo. \u201cI stand by my tweet,\u201d she said. \u201cI find the typo disrespectful to the survivors in Manchester.\u201d The Met said: \u201cWe can confirm that a complaint has been received by the Metropolitan Police Service on Tuesday 23 May in relation to a tweet published on the same day. \u201cAs is routine, the allegation will be reviewed and assessed by specialist officers.\u201d The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged people to show their support for Manchester by attending tonight\u2019s vigil in the city centre. Speaking after taking part, via video link, in the government\u2019s emergency meeting,he said: There is a need for the city, and the city region, to come together, so we are making arrangements for a vigil in the centre of Manchester this evening in Albert Square in front of the town hall. It is important that we send out that clear message, that though we are grieving we our strong and we are together. I would urge people to show their support by possibly attending the vigil tonight. The most important message we must all send together is that we are united and we will not let them win. Burnham also paid tribute to the response of the city. He said: \u201cThe idea that people just throw their doors open or make their car available to people, it tells you everything about the people of Greater Manchester. It is the best response because it is what the extremists don\u2019t want. \u201cThat\u2019s what the people here are like. They will never beat us \u2026 \u201cIn this darkest hour, every single person in Greater Manchester will be proud that people responded in that particular way. It is a case of return to business as usual as far as possible. We will not let these people win. \u201cWe all feel an sense of abhorrence at the nature of this attack. I\u2019m not alone in saying that my kids have been at that venue at that particular time of night. Everybody here has a similar experience. For individuals to go there and seek to terrorise those children and those young people and their families in that way is the most appalling evil act that I can imagine.\u201d And Burnham condemned \u201cill-informed\u201d comments about those responsible. He said: People should avoid some of the ill-informed comment on social media. Take the lead from what the police are saying here before people jump to any conclusions about this attack. For goodness sake, let\u2019s not descend into a situation of mutual distrust between our communities. The individual who carried this out is an extremist and and doesn\u2019t represent any of our communities and does not represent the people of Greater Manchester in any way, shape or form. May says she will travel to Manchester later to meet the chief constable, the mayor and the emergency services. The election campaign has been suspended, she says. She says she will chair another Cobra meeting later today. She says it is customary for leaders to condemn the attackers. But the fact we have to say this again does not make this any less true, she says. She says we should remember the countless acts of kindness that brought people together, the work of the emergency services and the messages of solidarity and hope from those who opened their homes to victims. \u201cThese are the things that represent the spirit of Manchester. It will never be broken.\u201d She says there will be difficult days ahead. Let us remember those who died, and think of those who helped. Our way of life will always prevail, she says. That\u2019s it. May\u2019s statement is over. May says if others are responsible for the attack, they will be brought to justice. The police believe that attack was carried out by one person. But they need to find out if they were acting alone. The police think they know the identity of the perpetrator. But the police are not at this point revealing their name. She says doctors and medical staff have worked valiantly to attend to those injured. More resources are being devoted to the police, she says. She says the scene around Manchester Arena will be closed for some time. May says the police were called to Manchester Arena at 10.33pm. A single terrorist detonated a device near the exit, at a time and place intended to cause maximum injuries. All terrorist attacks are terrible, but this stands out for its cowardice, she says. She says, in addition to the attacker, 22 people have died, and 59 people are being treated in hospital. Many have life-threatening injuries, she says. Theresa May is making her statement about the Manchester attack in Downing Street. She says she has just chaired a Cobra meeting. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those affected. The people of Manchester have fallen victim to a \u201ccallous terrorist attack\u201d, she says. It is the worst attack Manchester has suffered, and the worst to hit the north of England. Blood donor centres in Manchester have experienced a surge in would-be donors presenting themselves to offer their blood. However, the centres are fully stocked. Jane Green, the chief nurse at the Plymouth Donor Centre opposite the Manchester Royal Infirmary, said they had been overwhelmed by people arriving to donate blood, but were turning spontaneous arrivals away as the centre was fully stocked and had a fully booked day of pre-arranged appointments. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, says a vigil will be held for the victims in Manchester tonight. \u201cWe will never be beaten,\u201d he says. He urges people not to jump to conclusions about the attacker. He condemns the attacker as an extremist who doesn\u2019t represent any community. The government is not planning to increase the threat level to \u201ccritical\u201d in the aftermath of the Manchester attack. The threat level has been at \u201csevere\u201d, the fourth highest ranking, since 2014. Moving it on to the fifth and highest level would only be done if the police and intelligence services feared another attack was imminent. MI5, which has a regional office in the north-west of England, has been been working through the night with police. Much of the focus of the investigation is on where the attacker, who was killed in the attack, obtained the ingredients for making a bomb. Details of how to make a bomb can be found on the internet, but a degree of training is usually needed to succeed in detonating it. With the amount of CCTV footage available, the police could have been able to quickly establish the identity of the attacker. Theresa May has spoken to President Trump about the attack, the White House has announced. The love and solidarity of Mancunians shone through in their immediate response to the attack on the arena, writes Owen Jones. Yesterday, Manchester was one of the greatest cities on earth, and it remains so today. The warmth, the solidarity, the unique Manc humour, all of that will thrive as much as it ever did. This was the city that helped bequeath modern industrial civilisation; it is a hurricane of creativity and talent, like the music of Oasis and the Smiths, the art of Lowry, Corrie, the football, the athletes, the comedians, the suffragettes, the LGBT activists. Manchester police has again urged the public to avoid the city centre while emergency services work at the scene of the attack. Channel 4 News has been speaking to AJ Singh, one of the Manchester taxi drivers who offered free rides to those caught up in the attack. \u201cManchester, we\u2019re glue. We stick together when it counts,\u201d he said. Manchester University is advising that some exams may be disrupted but that students should assume they will go ahead as scheduled. This is from Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. Channel 4 News\u2019s Michael Crick says this is not the first terrorist attack during a general election campaign. Concert-goers have criticised security at the Manchester Arena, with some saying bags were not checked. Nikola Trochtova, a Czech woman who was at the Ariana Grande concert in the venue, told Czech public radio that \u201cthere was absolutely no security check\u201d. She added: \u201cThey let us get in without any check if we have anything with us \u2026 the only thing they were interested in was if we had any bottles of water with us. They almost didn\u2019t check our bags, they didn\u2019t take a look.\u201d The Associated Press reports Trochtova as saying she was leaving the venue when she heard an explosion at the entrance, but only found out what had happened when she returned to her hotel. Others have posted on social media about what they deemed to be lax security checks at the venue, with mixed reports as to whether bags were checked upon entrance to the sold-out 21,000-person capacity stadium. One Twitter user said: \u201cThe last 3 times I\u2019ve seen a show at Manchester arena, they didn\u2019t check my bag even though I had a backpack on. \u201cFor One Direction, they just kind of jiggled my bag, \u2018feeling\u2019 if there was anything harmful. Had a 1L bottle of Lucozade, didn\u2019t open my bag. Didn\u2019t even check my bag at all for Little Mix nor 5SOS, despite my bag being full and quite heavy.\u201d Another said: \u201cBeing there at the concert in Manchester, I\u2019m not surprised someone was able to take something into the arena. Security was horrendous \u2026 Only a bag check, no metal scanners or patdowns for anyone entering through the Manchester Victoria entrance of the arena.\u201d Agnes Bergman wrote: Theresa May is expected to make a statement outside No 10 within the next half an hour or so. She has been chairing a meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee. There is no prospect of parliament being recalled because, following the dissolution of parliament for the election, there are no MPs at the moment. According to the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn, May will then travel to Manchester. With the GCSE exam season under way in schools, the examinations regulator Ofqual, said headteachers are best placed to decide whether exams should be postponed. It said: \u201cMany students and teachers are likely to have been affected by the tragic events in Manchester last night. Headteachers are best placed to decide whether exams should go ahead as planned. \u201cWe will consider with the exam boards how the provisions that are normally made for students who are unable to sit their exams when planned, or who take their exams but whose performance might be affected, will be applied. \u201cStudents and their parents should seek advice and information from their schools. Our thoughts are with everyone affected.\u201d While Manchester city centre is unusually quiet this morning, a lot of people have made their way to work as normal. The police cordon now only surrounds the area near the arena. There are lots of dazed parents with their teenage daughters, who appear to have been at last night\u2019s concert, leaving hotels and making their way towards Piccadilly station. Hayley Lunt and her 10-year-old daughter, Annabel, have just come out of the Premier Inn near the arena. They were at the concert last night and are still shaken. They haven\u2019t slept since they ran to their hotel for safety following the blast. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. It\u2019s almost like we weren\u2019t there,\u201d Lunt told a huddle of journalists. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad movie. I think it\u2019ll take a few days for us to come to terms with it.\u201d The pair, who are from near Bradford, were gathering their belongings at the end of the concert when they heard bangs, which they initially took to be gunshots. Lunt says she knew immediately that something terrible had happened. \u201cIt was just hysteria and we just ran,\u201d she says. \u201cWe found another young girl who lost her dad and we were just running along the street with her. Then thankfully, she found her dad and we just headed straight here. It was just utter chaos and terrifying. \u201cIt just makes you frightened to take your child anywhere. It was her first proper concert and I\u2019m just thinking, will she want to do anything again.\u201d Scotland\u2019s chief constable has deployed armed police on high-visibility patrols in crowded areas, airports and railway stations after stepping up security following the Manchester Arena attack. Phil Gormley, a former Met police counter-terrorism commander, said: \u201cMy thoughts and those of everyone at Police Scotland are with those who have lost loved ones or who were injured in the attack in Manchester. \u201cAs part of the UK-wide response to these events, Police Scotland continues to review all safety and security plans and operations. This includes ensuring our armed policing and specialist resources are appropriately deployed. \u201cPeople will therefore see armed police on patrol at transport hubs and crowded places. There is no intelligence to suggest there is any threat to Scotland but I would ask the public to remain alert and report anything suspicious.\u201d These are from Brendan Cox, whose wife, Jo, was murdered by a far-right terrorist during the EU referendum last year. The dean of Manchester, Rogers Govender, led prayers close to the arena. Govender explained that normal morning prayers could not take place at the cathedral because it was within the cordon. He said: \u201cWe pray for all the people of Greater Manchester at this time. We give you thanks for our city and our city region. We pray for all places of prayer and worship in our city as they become places of refuge and comfort for all of our people. \u201cWe pray for ourselves that you fill us with compassion for those who suffer violence. We pray you give us a renewed sense of what a gift it is to live each day in peace and freedom. Help us not to allow ourselves to be diminished by fear and make us instruments of your peace in our homes, our communities and in this great city.\u201d A city councillor, Patrick Karney, read Psalm 125, which ends with: \u201cPeace be on Israel\u201d and added: \u201cPeace be on Manchester.\u201d Teenage girls, some with their mothers, are beginning to leave the hotels near the arena where they spent the night. Karen Moore, from Derby, who was with her daughter Molly, said neither had slept a wink. They had booked into a hotel, but became disorientated after leaving the arena and found themselves in the foyer of a different hotel. \u201cThey told us we\u2019d better stay there and gave us quilts and pillows,\u201d said Moore. Mother and daughter were at the front of the arena when they heard the explosion. \u201cEveryone was screaming, completely hysterical,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe just want to get home now \u2013 it\u2019s been terrible, just awful.\u201d Our northern editor, Helen Pidd, has just spoken to an A&amp;E doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). He said many consultants came in unprompted during the night to help deal with what appeared to be a roughly equal number of child and adult casualties. The injuries ran the gamut from \u201cmajor trauma\u201d to cuts and scratches, he said. A triage system at the arena decided which patients to send to which hospital. MRI took all the major trauma cases not involving head injuries, which were taken to Salford Royal (often known locally as Salford Hope.) The doctor, who asked not to be named, said he did not know if the bomber was treated at MRI. \u201cWe don\u2019t get told these things. We just get on with treating everyone as best we can,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Give Blood NHS, has urged the public to keep appointments, particularly if they are group O negative. But it says it has the blood required for now. If you\u2019ve been affected by the suicide bomb attack in Manchester, you can share your experiences with us.

Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, tweeted his condolences. \u201cHeroic Manchester, dark evil cannot overcome it. We pray for those in sorrow on the hard journey of loss &amp; pain, &amp; for those who protect us,\u201d he wrote. David Walker, the bishop of Manchester, said: \u201cWhat makes this latest atrocity particularly dreadful is the deliberate choice of a concert known to attract very young fans. Many lives will be lived out, impacted by this tragedy for long years to come. Others have had decades of life ripped away from them. \u201cThere is a proper anger and rage in the face of events like this. Our challenge will be to direct that rage and anger to be a force for good. We will rally around the victims and their families. We will unite across our diversity, drawing close especially to any that the terrorists would seek to separate us from. And we will rebuild and repair the damage to our city, as we have done before.\u201d Churches in Greater Manchester would be open for people to pray today, he added. Harun Khan, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThis is horrific, this is criminal. May the perpetrators face the full weight of justice both in this life and the next. \u201cI pay tribute to the police and emergency services who have worked valiantly to save lives last night. They were helped by civilians who rushed in to offer their support. I urge all those in the region and around the country to pool together to support those affected.\u201d The counter-extremist organisation Faith Matters said that actions against groups promoting Islamist and victimisation narratives had rarely been effective \u201cwhen they create a fertile ground for mindsets who believe that they are being targeted by the government because they are Muslim. This causes them to become more and more isolated and drawn to further extremist rhetoric\u201d. Founder Fiyaz Mughal added: \u201cWe are moving into another phase given the Manchester killings. For years, government has had its hands tied behind its back and worried about legal action against it if it acts against groups. Manchester should be a turning point and a realisation that terrorists will not stop their murder of innocent people. \u201cWe have to ensure that groups promoting Islamist and far-right extremist rhetoric are challenged, shown for the hypocrites that they are and that they are a fundamental threat to our democracy.\u201d John Arnold, the Catholic bishop of Manchester, said such an attack \u201ccan have no justification\u201d. The general assembly of the Church of Scotland opened in Edinburgh with prayers and silence for the victims of the attack. \u201cThat young people and children, with others, could be the subject of what police are now treating as a premeditated act of violence is beyond comprehension. There is no cause, political or religious, that justifies actions of senseless brutality, anywhere or at any time,\u201d said the moderator Derek Browning. The European Jewish Congress condemned the attack. It \u201cdemonstrates once again that the enemies of civilisation have no boundaries,\u201d Moshe Kantor, the EJC president, said. \u201cThis was a concert attended by mostly young people and children and is a ghastly reminder that terrorism sees all of us as potential targets, regardless of age, religion, nationality or background.\u201d Bhai Amrik Singh, the chair of the Sikh Federation UK, said: \u201cThe suicide bomber who mindlessly targeted innocent young people in the Manchester Arena must have been deranged. \u201cI would like to applaud Sikhs living and working in Manchester who immediately came to the support of those caught up in the terror attack. This ranged from Sikh taxi drivers who drove people away from the danger to our Gurdwaras, who opened their doors to help strangers.\u201d The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, Cressida Dick, has confirmed that more police are being deployed in London. In a statement she said: \u201cThis is an utterly appalling attack. My thoughts are with the people of Manchester as they try to come to terms with the horrific events that took place in their city last night. Our colleagues from Greater Manchester police and their emergency services showed huge bravery as they ran towards the confusion and danger. \u201cWe are providing every possible support through the counter-terrorism network as investigators work tirelessly to understand what has happened. \u201cHere in the capital we put extra police officers on duty as Londoners started their journeys into work. This will continue for as long as it is needed, and the mix of armed and unarmed officers are there to reassure. \u201cLooking ahead to the weekend \u2013 a normal busy and vibrant weekend in our city \u2013 we are working with all those planning events to make sure we are doing all we can. \u201cTerrorists seek to spread fear and undermine our way of life. We must work together to stop that from happening. If you have suspicions, tell us; if you see something that concerns you, report it. Together, we can protect London.\u201d Speaking in Brussels for a meeting of EU finance ministers, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: Obviously I woke up this morning to the terrible news of this barbaric attack in Manchester. It is, as far as we know, a terrorist incident. We are treating it as such. My thoughts are with the victims and their families, and the people of Manchester. And I\u2019d like to pay tribute to the emergency services who have done a great job throughout the night and are continuing to work at the scene. The government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra will be meeting in the next hour or so, and I shall attend the Ecofin meeting now and then return to London at lunchtime. Hammond was due to give a speech to European business leaders but cancelled his plans. The parents and friends of two girls from the Hebridean island of Barra, Laura MacIntyre and Eilidh MacLeod, both 15, have issued urgent appeals after they went missing after the Manchester attack. Laura Macintyre\u2019s father Micheal, who works for the fish farm multinational Marine Harvest, issued an urgent request for help to trace his daughter on Twitter . Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National party MP for the Western Isles, knows the MacIntyres. He said his daughter had had sleepovers with Laura MacIntyre. MacNeil said he had spoken to the fathers of both girls this morning. \u201cI just can\u2019t begin to get to the depths of their worries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are without doubt missing.\u201d He said Eilidh MacLeod\u2019s father was flying from Benbecula to Manchester while members of the MacIntyre family were also making their way to the city Here\u2019s what Trump said in full: I extend my deepest condolences to those so terribly injured in this terrorist attack and to the many killed and the families \u2013 so many families of the victims. We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. So many young beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life. I won\u2019t call them monsters because they would like that term. They would think that\u2019s a great name. I will call them, from now on, losers, because that\u2019s what they are. They are losers. And we will have more of them. But they are losers, just remember that. Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed, we cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people. And in today\u2019s attack it was mostly innocent children. The terrorists and extremists and those who give them aid and comfort must be driven out from our society for ever. This wicked ideology must be obliterated and I mean completely obliterated, and the innocent life must be protected. All civilised nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right our citizens to live in safety and in peace. Donald Trump has condemned the attack. Speaking in Bethlehem he said: \u201cWe stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.\u201d He said those responsible for the attack were \u201closers\u201d and \u201cwicked\u201d. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has added to the international chorus of condolence for Britain. These are from David Cameron, the former prime minister. This is from Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister. Melania Trump, the US first lady, has tweeted this. The Manchester bombing was also condemned by senior Israeli political figures including the country\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI am sending condolences to the families of those murdered and wishes of a speedy recovery to the wounded,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cTerrorism is a global threat and it is incumbent on the enlightened countries to defeat it everywhere.\u201d Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog also offered his condolences. \u201cA horrific attack in Manchester. My thoughts and condolences are with the British people, who I know will never be defeated by terror,\u201d he writes on Twitter. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has spoken of her sadness and shock. \u201cPeople in the UK can rest assured that Germany stands shoulder to shoulder with them.\u201d Many world leaders have sent messages of support to the UK. Writing on Twitter, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he is \u201cpained by the attack in Manchester\u201d. The Indian president, Pranab Mukherjee, has also sent his condolences and prayers: Italy\u2019s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, says his thoughts are with the victims. And flags are flying at half mast too outside the European commission HQ in Brussels. Flags are flying at half mast over Downing Street. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, condemned the atrocity, writes Sam Jones in Madrid. \u201cMy condolences to the families of the dead and my best wishes for the victims\u2019 speedy recovery,\u201d Rajoy said on Twitter. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Alfonso Dastis, said he was distressed by the attack and offered \u201cmy solidarity to all the victims and the British people, and my total support to the government\u201d. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, the recently re-elected leader of Spain\u2019s socialist party, said that his thoughts were with the victims and their families and called for \u201cunity to stop so much fanaticism\u201d. In a statement, Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said the country had been \u201chorrified\u201d by the attack. \u201cThe government forcefully and unequivocally condemns these vile acts and hopes that those responsible will face justice for their crimes as swiftly as possible,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government, in the name of the Spanish people, sends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims and reiterates its support and solidarity with the British people and authorities. The ministry added that while there was so far nothing to suggest that any Spanish citizens had been injured or killed, its consulates in London and Edinburgh were in close contact with the British authorities. Theresa May is chairing a meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, to discuss the Manchester attack this morning. It is due to start at 9am. Here is Amber Rudd, the home secretary, arriving at Downing Street a few minutes ago for the meeting. The Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, has joined political leaders in suspending all general election campaigning, with the Scottish National party cancelling the launch this morning of its election manifesto. Dugdale issued a statement on the Manchester attack to say: \u201cThis is a barbaric and sickening attack, targeted at young and vulnerable people enjoying a night at a concert. It is a heartbreaking moment for our country, and our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have lost their lives and with those who are injured. Across the UK we are today grieving for the people of Manchester. I pay tribute to the dedication of the brave emergency service workers who ran into danger. \u201cWe have all been moved by the actions of ordinary people who opened their doors, cared for scared youngsters, provided transport to concert-goers, and are giving blood at donor banks to help those injured. This great city is today demonstrating to the world the true spirit of Manchester.\u201d The Greens have confirmed that they are also suspending all election activities, among them the planned manifesto launch by the Welsh Greens. The party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, said: \u201cOur thoughts are with those affected by this appalling incident in Manchester. For young people to be targeted in this way is utterly atrocious. As ever our emergency services have done us proud \u2013 and we pay tribute to the police, firefighters and paramedics who stepped up in this time of need. Our country will never be divided by terror.\u201d London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has confirmed that security is being reviewed and stepped up in the capital. \u201cI am in constant contact with the Metropolitan police, who are reviewing security arrangements in London. Londoners will see more police on our streets,\u201d he said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has expressed his \u201chorror\u201d and \u201cdistress\u201d at the Manchester attack. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said Macron was planning to speak to Theresa May later today, writes Kim Willsher. In a statement (see earlier) the recently elected French leader said he sent the British people France\u2019s \u201ccompassion and sorrow\u201d and pledged to continue working with Britain to fight terrorism. France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, condemned what he called \u201cthe most cowardly terrorism\u201d that had \u201cspecifically and clearly\u201d targeted young people going to a concert. \u201cIn the face of this abominable crime, I would like to express to the citizens of Manchester and the British people, my sadness, the French people\u2019s solidarity and unwavering friendship,\u201d Philippe told AFP. French government spokesman Christophe Castaner tweeted: \u201cOnce more attacked, our democracies must work together. My thoughts and solidarity go to the victims, their families and the British...\u201d Interior minister G\u00e9rard Collomb also Tweeted sympathy to Manchester. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, wrote on Twitter: \u201cTonight Paris stands with Manchester\u201d. French-Canadian singer C\u00e9line Dion wrote: \u201cManchester, I am with you. All my love\u201d. A report of a suspicious package at Victoria coach station in London this morning was a false alarm, according to the Metropolitan police. Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, has spoken of the city\u2019s determination to defeat terrorism. Speaking alongside Andy Burnham, Leese said: \u201cOur thought are with the families and friends of the victims. As a city we will have to take some time to grieve. We have to ensure that terrorism never wins so business as usual as much as possible, communities coming together \u2013 we will not allow this to divide us. As citizens of Manchester demonstrated last night, this city will pull together. A dark day but something that Manchester in its unique way will make sure we turn into a strength. We need to be alert but we must not be afraid.\u201d The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has given this statement: \u201cIt was with great sadness and profound shock that I learnt of the brutal attack that struck Manchester. It breaks my heart to think that, once again, terrorism has sought to instil fear where there should be joy, to sow division where young people and families should be coming together in celebration. I would like to convey my deepest sympathies to Prime Minister May and to the British people. Today we mourn with you. Tomorrow we will work side by side with you to fight back against those who seek to destroy our way of life. They underestimate ours and your resilience \u2013 these cowardly attacks will only strengthen our commitment to work together to defeat the perpetrators of such vile acts.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken of his horror and consternation at the attack. In a statement he offered his sympathies to the British people and promised that France and Britain would work together to combat terrorism. He also said he would speak to Theresa May later today. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, was asked how the attack compared with the 7/7 attack in London in 2005. He said: I was in the Home Office as a minister on that day, and I remember how London felt on that day. I remember it very vividly. London pulled together in exactly the same way that Manchester is its own unique way will pull together. We will stand strong, and stand together, that\u2019s what we are. That\u2019s what we do. So they won\u2019t win. We are grieving, we are hurt today, but as I said we are strong. And this city has dealt with difficult days in the past and we do so now. Burnham also confirmed that he would be taking part in the government\u2019s emergency Cobra meeting via video-link from Manchester. He said: \u201cI will be heading over to Greater Manchester police force headquarters after this press call to take part in the Cobra meeting alongside the police constable. There will be a further update after that. We will work with the government to give the people the reassurance that they need, and to insure that, as far as possible, that we return to business as usual in the city.\u201d Steve Morris in Manchester has this footage of his statement. Police have confirmed that 22 people have been killed \u2013 including some children \u2013 and 59 injured after an explosion at Manchester Arena at the end of a concert by Ariana Grande. Greater Manchester police say the perpetrator was a man acting alone, who died at the scene after detonating an improvised explosive device. Investigators are trying to establish whether the bomber was part of a wider network. The blast took place outside the arena, in the public foyer, shortly after 10.30pm, minutes after the concert ended. No identities of those killed or injured have been confirmed. No arrests have been made. The wounded are receiving treatment in eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. The prime minister, Theresa May, will chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee at 9am today. In an overnight statement, May said: We are working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. Party leaders Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Tim Farron, Leanne Wood and Paul Nuttall also expressed condolences. Campaigning for June\u2019s general election has been suspended. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham called it \u201can evil act\u201d that would not succeed in breaking the spirit of the city. Ariana Grande, who was not hurt in the explosion, tweeted that she was: \u201cbroken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don\u2019t have words.\u201d A large area around the arena has been cordoned off. Victoria station has been closed and train services cancelled for the whole of Tuesday. Police have asked people to stay away from the area. British Transport Police said extra officers, some armed, would be on patrol today. Greater Manchester police have set up a hotline for those concerned about relatives or friends who might have been caught up in the Manchester explosion: 0161 856 9400. The Lee Rigby Foundation, which offers support for bereaved families in memory of the soldier who was murdered by terrorists in 2013, has tweeted its shock and sorrow at last night\u2019s attack. Rigby was killed on 22 May 2013; the Manchester attack fell on the fourth anniversary of his death. For some it sounded muffled and far away, as though somewhere in the distance a big balloon had popped. For others the terror was all too immediately apparent. The lights had just come on and Ariana Grande had left the stage after concluding an elaborate three-hour, four-part entertainment extravaganza with an encore performance of her latest single, Dangerous Woman. At 10.30pm following a sold-out show in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, thousands of fans began to gather up their belongings and filter slowly out of four exits. Then the bang. For the first milliseconds, minds did not immediately connect the sound with an explosion or a bomb. \u201cIt sounded like a big balloon popping, but it was kind of muffled, like it wasn\u2019t in the stadium itself,\u201d said a young Mancunian fan, identified as Sammy, in a video he recorded of his experience and posted on Periscope. \u201cThere were a few screams, then there was silence. Then the whole arena literally split like the Red Sea \u2013 everyone was trampling over each other, sprinting to get to the nearest exit. It was like a scene out of a horror movie.\u201d The archbishop of Canterbury has tweeted his condolences to those affected: The Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, has joined other parties in halting election campaigning: The thoughts and sympathies of all of us in Plaid Cymru go out to all the people affected by last night\u2019s horrific events in Manchester. We will be suspending our campaigning today as a mark of respect to all of the families. Charlotte Campbell\u2019s 15-year-old daughter, Olivia, is still missing after the concert. She spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, where she began by saying when she last talked to her daughter: She was at the concert. She\u2019d just seen the support act and said she was having an amazing time, and thanking me for letting her go. She was with her friend, Adam. Adam was found about half an hour ago \u2013 he\u2019s in hospital \u2013 but Olivia\u2019s not been found yet. I\u2019m at home phoning everybody: hospitals, police, the centres that the children have been put in. Her dad\u2019s in Manchester looking for her. I\u2019ve got friends looking for her. I\u2019ve got people I don\u2019t even know looking for her, people messaging me, saying we\u2019ve got her photo, looking for her, we\u2019ll get in contact if we see her. And I\u2019m just hearing nothing. Her phone\u2019s dead. Social media has been wonderful. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve have done without them, it\u2019s made it so aware that she\u2019s missing. There\u2019s thousands of people who now know she\u2019s missing, there\u2019s people out looking for her I don\u2019t know, and I can\u2019t thank these people enough, giving their time up. They\u2019ve basically told me to stay put and wait for a phone call. I daren\u2019t leave the house just in case she somehow gets home. Andy Burnham, the new mayor of Greater Manchester, has been speaking in the city about the attack, which he describes as \u201can evil act\u201d. He says his thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends: We will do whatever we can to support them. We are grieving today but we are strong. He also pays tribute to the emergency services: I want to thank the hundreds of police, fire and ambulance staff who worked through the night \u2026 I want to thank the people of Manchester: even in the minutes after the attack they opened their doors to strangers and drove them away from danger \u2026 It will be that spirit of Manchester that will prevail and hold us together. Burnham says he was a minister in the Home Office during the 7/7 attacks on London, which killed 52 people: I remember how London felt on that day, I remember it vividly \u2026 Manchester will pull together \u2026 that\u2019s what we are, that\u2019s what we do. They won\u2019t win. This city has dealt with difficult things in the past and we will do so now. The explosion happened moments after the end of a concert at Manchester Arena by Ariana Grande. Grande, who was not hurt in the blast, tweeted earlier that she was \u201cbroken\u201d by news of the casualties: The US president Donald Trump, on a visit to Israel, is being updated on the situation in Manchester, White House spokesman Sean Spicer has confirmed: Key updates from the most recent police press conference: The death toll has risen to 22. Among the dead are children. A further 59 people are injured and receiving treatment in eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. Police believe the attack was carried out by one man, and are investigating if he was part of a wider network. The man died at the scene after detonating an explosive device \u2013 a suicide bomber. Chief constable Ian Hopkins confirms that 22 people have died and a further 59 have been injured. This has been the most horrific incident we have had to face in Greater Manchester and one that we all hoped we would never see. Families and many young people were out to enjoy a concert at the Manchester Arena and have lost their lives. Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones. We continue to do all we can to support them. They are being treated at eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. This is a fast-moving investigation and we have significant resources deployed to both the investigation and the visible patrols that people will see across Greater Manchester as they wake up to news of the events last night. This will include armed officers as people would expect. More than 400 officers have been involved in the operation during the night. To remind you, we were called at 10.33pm to reports of an explosion at the Manchester Arena at the conclusion of an Ariana Grande concert. More than 250 calls came in and emergency services were very quickly on scene. Emergency numbers have been established for anyone who is concerned for loved ones who may not have returned home: 0161 856 9400 or 0161 856 9900. We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe that while the attack last night was conducted by one man. The priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network. The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena. We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device, which he detonated, causing this atrocity. We would ask people not to speculate on his details or to share names. There is a complex and wide-ranging investigation under way. Our priority is to work with the national counter-terrorist policing network and UK intelligence services to establish more details about the individual who carried out this attack. Hopkins confirms that children are among the 22 people confirmed to have died. Chief constable Ian Hopkins says the attacker died in the explosion. He says that while police believe the man was acting alone in the attack last night, investigations are ongoing to establish if he was part of a network. He says police believe the man was \u201ccarrying an improvised explosive device, which he detonated causing this atrocity\u201d. Greater Manchester police says 22 people have died, and 59 injured. We are expecting an update shortly from Greater Manchester police\u2019s chief constable, Ian Hopkins, which will be covered here as it happens. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, is also due to speak within the next hour, and we\u2019ll have that on the live blog too. Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader who is also MEP for North West England, has confirmed that his party will also suspend its election campaigning. In a statement on Tuesday morning, Nuttall said: Just woken to the terrible news in the heart of my constituency, Manchester. My prayers and thoughts are with those affected. Stay strong. In light of what\u2019s happened I have suspended the Ukip general election campaign. Other parties have already announced their intention to pause campaigning. The leader of Manchester city council, Richard Leese, has said it is \u201cimpossible to imagine a worse night in the history of the city\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: As the chief constable has said, our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims, and those people who are still, in some cases, critically injured, in what is a truly appalling night. City council staff had worked overnight with police, he said, \u201cdoing what we can\u201d to help people in trouble. Leese continued: I\u2019ve heard lots of stories about how the broader Manchester community has opened up \u2013 free taxi rides, offers of accommodation, all the things that a good community will do to try and support in what is going to be the worst possible moment in their lives. I think that has to be part of the story. It is a tragedy, the loss of life is truly appalling, but as a city, as a community, we will continue to pull together, and we will not allow ourselves to be beaten. We don\u2019t know what the cause is yet. Clearly there is lots of supposition taking place. But this is not something that we are going to allow to beat us as a Manchester community. In the aftermath of the attack in Manchester, witnesses spoke to Guardian reporters about the moments after the concert had finished, when a loud bang was heard by those inside the arena. Majid Khan, 22, said: A huge bomb-like bang went off that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena. It was one bang and essentially everyone from the other side of the arena where the bang was heard from suddenly came running towards us as they were trying to exit. Oliver Jones, 17, who attended with his 19-year-old sister, said: The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run. People outside the concert were visibly upset, as a cacophony of sirens were heard as police and ambulance vehicles arrived at the scene. Erin McDougle, 20, from Newcastle said: There was a loud bang at the end of the concert. The lights were already on so we knew it wasn\u2019t part of the show. At first we thought it was a bomb. There was a lot of smoke. People started running out. When we got outside the arena there were dozens of police vans and quite a few ambulances. A group of young men from Sheffield said they had seen at least five people covered in blood and others being carried out by bouncers. One told the Guardian: Ariana Grande had just gone behind the curtain and the lights came up when there was this massive bang and a big cloud of smoke. I saw five people with blood all down them. Sophie Tedd, 25, from Darlington, said: Everyone started screaming and we nearly got trampled on. There was a burning smell. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, who will attend this morning\u2019s emergency Cobra meeting, has added to the tributes to emergency services: This was a barbaric attack, deliberately targeting some of the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 young people and children out at a pop concert. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families and victims who have been affected, and I know the whole country will share that view. I\u2019d like to pay tribute to the emergency services who have worked throughout the night professionally and effectively; they have done an excellent job. Later on this morning I will be attending Cobra, chaired by the prime minister, to collect more information, to find out more, about this particular attack, and I can\u2019t comment any more on that at the moment. The public should remain alert but not alarmed. If they have anything to report, they should approach the police. But I have two further things to add. The great city of Manchester has been affected by terrorism before. Its spirit was not bowed; its community continued. This time it has been a particular attack on the most vulnerable in our society. Its intention was to sow fear; its intention is to divide. But it will not succeed. One of the missing concertgoers whose photograph is being widely shared on social media is Olivia Campbell, a teenager who attended the concert as part of a birthday present for her friend, Adam, who is also missing. Her mother, Charlotte, told CNN she last spoke to her daughter around 8.30pm, several hours before the blast: It\u2019s the most horrible feeling ever to know your daughter is there and you can\u2019t find her, and you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s dead or alive. I don\u2019t know how people can do this to innocent children. She said Adam and Olivia had \u201cdone nothing but talk about\u201d the concert in the past few days: They\u2019re normal teenage children who were going to see their favourite artist and it\u2019s ended in absolute carnage. Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that Labour will join the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and SNP in suspending campaigning for the 8 June general election. In a statement this morning, the Labour leader says: I am horrified by the horrendous events in Manchester last night. My thoughts are with family and friends of those who have died and been injured. Today the whole country will grieve for the people who have lost their lives. I have spoken with Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester, who has fully briefed me on the operational response in the city. I would like to pay tribute to the emergency services for their bravery and professionalism in dealing with last night\u2019s appalling events. I have spoken with the prime minister and we have agreed that all national campaigning in the general election will be suspended until further notice. At least 19 people have been killed and around 5o injured after an explosion at Manchester Arena at the end of a concert by Ariana Grande.

The blast was reported to have taken place outside the arena, in the public foyer, shortly after 10.30pm. North West ambulance services said 60 ambulances were dispatched to the arena, with 59 people transferred to six hospitals across Greater Manchester, and a number of \u201cwalking wounded\u201d treated at the scene.

All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. Party leaders Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Tim Farron also expressed condolences. Campaigning for June\u2019s general election has been suspended. Ariana Grande, who was not hurt in the explosion, which occurred just moments after her show finished, tweeted that she was \u201cbroken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don\u2019t have words.\u201d A large area around the arena has been cordoned off. Victoria station has been closed and train services cancelled for the whole of Tuesday.

CCTV, China\u2019s state broadcaster, is reporting that Chinese president Xi Jinping has sent a message to the Queen expressing his \u201csincere condolences\u201d to those killed and injured in the explosion in Manchester and to their families. \u201cThe Chinese people are firmly standing together with the British people at this difficult time,\u201d Xi told the Queen, according to a brief announcement by the channel. Health workers visiting Manchester have offered to pitch in to help care for those injured in an explosion at a concert in the city, Press Association reports: NHS staff attending a conference in the city offered support to local hospitals treating the wounded. North West Ambulance NHS Trust sent 60 ambulances to the scene of the suspected terror attack. It said 59 casualties had been taken to nearby hospitals and a number of walking wounded were treated at the scene. Greater Manchester police said that the injured were being treated at six local hospitals. Kirsty Withers, a theatre clinical manager at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay (UHMB) NHS Foundation Trust, offered assistance to Manchester Royal Infirmary online, writing: \u201cWe are visiting for a health conference from morecambe bay trust tomorrow 3 Theatre ODPs available if needed.\u201d Stuart Hosking-Durn, an emergency preparedness, resilience and response professional with UHMB, also used Twitter to offer help, posting: \u201cdo you need extra hands, we have staff in Manchester, have ID and can attend.\u201d Mancunian GP Faizan Awan tweeted: \u201cIf you need any help doing clinical work either on wards or minors, let me know. Can be with you in 10 minutes.\u201d A reminder that Greater Manchester police has set up a hotline for those concerned about relatives or friends who might have been caught up in the Manchester explosion. It is 0161 856 9400. Police are also encouraging anyone who needs assistance in the area to find officers at the Etihad Stadium: World leaders have reacted with horror to the news that the incident is a suspected terror attack. Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, said: This incident, this attack, is especially vile especially criminal, especially horrific because it appears to have been deliberately directed at teenagers. This is an attack on innocence. Surely there is no crime more reprehensible than the murder of children. This is a direct and brutal attack on young people everywhere, on freedom everywhere. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has tweeted: Bill English, the prime minister of New Zealand, said: People have lost their young ones in this. So our condolences go out to any families who have suffered from this \u2026 It is devastating for parents if their young ones go off to entertainment, no one expects them to lose their lives in such a cruel and unpredictable way. Assistant chief constable Robin Smith of the British Transport Police (BTP) says extra officers, including armed officers, will be visible today in the wake of the Manchester explosion: As the public would expect in response to an incident such as this, extra BTP officers will be on patrol at key railway stations as well as on trains around the country. Throughout the day, commuters can expect to see additional officers on their journey. This will include both armed and unarmed officers. My officers are there to reassure concerned members of the public and we\u2019d ask people to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour by calling the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789 123. Until known otherwise, police are treating this as a terrorist incident. Incidents such as this will undoubtedly shock the nation, however, it is essential we stand together in unity against those who try to disrupt our lives. Manchester Victoria station remains closed, with services being heavily disrupted or suspended, we continue to urge people to avoid the area whilst the recovery efforts continue. We advise morning commuters to check with Transport for Greater Manchester, National Rail Enquiries and Northern before travelling. Here are those links: Transport for Greater Manchester National Rail Enquiries Northern The map shows the location of Manchester Arena; Victoria station, which is adjacent to the venue, remains closed with all trains services cancelled throughout Tuesday. Our latest report is here; these are the key developments: At least 19 people have been killed and 50 injured after what is being investigated as a suspected suicide bombing of a crowded pop concert in Manchester, the most deadly attack in Britain in a decade. The horror unfolded at around 10.30pm on Monday at the end of a concert by the American singer Ariana Grande, whose music is popular with children and teenagers. The attack, which took place in the foyer area of the arena, left hundreds of people fleeing in terror, with young people at the concert separated from their parents in the chaos. It left carnage inside the concert venue, with medics describing treating wounds consistent with shrapnel injury. Initial examination of the scene around the explosion has prompted police to investigate whether a suicide bomber was responsible, the Guardian understands. The hunt for those behind the attack involves the police counter-terrorism network and Britain\u2019s domestic security service MI5. If confirmed as a terrorist attack the death toll would make it the worst event of its kind in Britain since the 7/7 bombing in 2005, which hit London\u2019s transport network, killing 52 people. This brief video explainer sets out what we know so far about the explosion that has killed 19 people: Our North of England editor is at Manchester Royal infirmary, where some of the wounded are being treated: MRI accident and emergency department is in \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d according to staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime scene,\u201d said one, pointing to police forensics officers who are going in and out of the hospital with clear plastic evidence bags. Police officers are guarding the doors, behind two red signs saying \u201cmajor incident \u2013 no entry\u201d. As ambulances began to arrive around midnight, staff cleared A&amp;E of all patients unconnected to the Arena blast. Throughout the night relatives have arrived to see if their loved ones are here. Some have found them. Others get back in their car or taxi and check the next hospital. The Scottish National party was due to unveil its election manifesto on Tuesday; this has now been postponed. SNP leader and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon will instead chair a meeting of the devolved government\u2019s resilience committee. A statement from the first minister said: My thoughts are with the victims, their families and all those who have been affected by this barbaric attack in Manchester. The Scottish government is working with Police Scotland and the UK government to ensure that we have a full understanding of the developing situation. I will convene a meeting of the Scottish government\u2019s resilience committee this morning to receive an update and to consider any implications for Scotland. Police say they are currently treating the explosion as a suspected terrorist attack. If it is terrorism, it would be the deadliest attack in the UK since the 7 July 2005 bombings in London in which four suicide bombers killed 52 people, as well as themselves, on three underground trains and a bus. In March this year, Khalid Masood killed five people in Westminster before being shot dead by a police officer. North West ambulance services says 60 ambulances attended Manchester Arena in the wake of the blast. It previously confirmed that 59 people were taken to hospitals across Greater Manchester, with some \u201cwalking wounded\u201d treated at the scene. Police have said that 19 people are confirmed to have died, with around 50 injured. The explosion happened moments after the end of a concert at Manchester Arena by Ariana Grande. Grande, who was not hurt in the blast, has now tweeted that she is \u201cbroken\u201d by news of the casualties: Ariana Grande\u2019s manager Scooter Braun has said \u201cour hearts are broken\u201d following the suspected terrorist attack that took place after her concert at Manchester Arena: Residents of Manchester have mobilised in the hours after the attack, with offers of help for stranded and injured concertgoers flooding Twitter. Victoria train station was closed in the wake of the incident, and was expected to remain closed throughout Tuesday, leaving many people stuck in the city centre without a way home. As many as 21,000 people \u2013 many of whom were children and teenagers \u2013 were at the concert. Using the trending hashtag #roomformanchester, locals offered spare bedrooms, cups of tea and rides to people caught up in the attack. Taxi drivers reportedly converged on the city offering free lifts to people in need. Many people have yet to locate family and friends not seen since the concert. I\u2019ve just spoken to a family from the Philippines searching without success for a missing loved one at Manchester Royal Infirmary. The 17-year-old girl, who asked not to be named, said she was looking for her mum, last seen in the post-explosion chaos. She and her auntie were with two Mancunian women searching local hospitals. They know her mum\u2019s boyfriend was injured and has been located, but the mum is missing. They asked not to be named in case they worried family back home. But the teenager said: \u201cWhen the concert ended we heard a really big explosion, there was smoke coming out.\u201d Eyewitness Joe Gregory posted footage on Twitter that appears to show the explosion in the Manchester Arena at the end of a concert by Ariana Grande. Gregory said he had been waiting outside the arena for his girlfriend, who was attending the concert. Here is the full update from Greater Manchester chief constable Ian Hopkins: I can confirm the details of events tonight that we currently know. At around 10.33pm last night we received reports of an explosion at the Manchester Arena in the city centre. It was at the conclusion of an Ariana Grande concert. Currently we have 19 people confirmed to have died and around 50 people injured. The injured are being treated at six hospitals across Greater Manchester. My thoughts are with all those who have been affected and we are doing all we can to support them. Officers from GMP and emergency services are working at the scene and are supporting those affected. We are coordinating the response from GMP headquarters. An emergency number is available for those who are concerned about loved ones or anyone who may have been in the area. It is 0161 856 9400. We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise. We are working closely with the national counter-terrorism policing network and UK intelligence partners. This is clearly a concerning time for people but we are doing all we can, working with local and national agencies to support those affected and gather information about what has happened tonight. As you will understand, we are still receiving information and updates, so will provide more details when we have a clearer picture. I want to thank people for their support and would ask them to remain vigilant and if they have any concerns report them in confidence to us on the anti-terrorist hotline: 0800 789321. It is important people avoid the area so that we can effectively deal with the incident. The US department of homeland security has issued a statement saying it is \u201cclosely monitoring the situation at Manchester Arena\u201d and that there could be \u201cincreased security\u201d in public places and music events in the US: We are working with our foreign counterparts to obtain additional information about the cause of the reported explosion as well as the extent of injuries and fatalities. US citizens in the area should heed direction from local authorities and maintain security awareness. We encourage any affected US citizens who need assistance to contact the US embassy in London and follow department of state guidance. At this time, we have no information to indicate a specific credible threat involving music venues in the United States. However, the public may experience increased security in and around public places and events as officials take additional precautions. We stand ready to assist our friends and allies in the UK in all ways necessary as they investigate and recover from this incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this incident. The North West ambulance service says it has taken 59 casualties from Manchester Arena to hospitals across the city. It says it also treated \u201ca number of walking wounded on scene\u201d. Greater Manchester police is holding an update to brief the press and public on the incident. Chief Constable Ian Hopkins says reports were received at 10.33pm of an explosion. He says 19 people have died, with a further 50 people injured and being treated at hospitals across Greater Manchester. He says an emergency number has been set up for those worried about loved ones: 0161 856 9400. We are currently treating this as a terrorist incident until we have further information \u2026 This is clearly a very concerning time for everyone. We are doing all that we can. He says police are working with other officials to investigate the circumstances of the explosion. He asks people to avoid the area around the arena while the investigation is ongoing. With campaigning for June\u2019s general election understandably suspended, politicians have been responding to the events in Manchester. Home secretary Amber Rudd said: My thoughts are with all those affected by this barbaric act. The full details of exactly what happened are still emerging, but I am proud of the police and first responders who reacted to this tragic incident so swiftly. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region metro mayor, said his daughters had been at the venue: Police said they were dealing with a possible terror incident at the Manchester Arena, with witnesses claiming to have heard an explosion around 10.40pm. Sources said the the initial theory was that a suicide bomber was behind the suspected explosion, which took place as revellers, many young, were leaving. It was feared the casualty toll may rise. Counter-terrorism officials were assessing what caused the explosion. Officers from the police and the domestic security service MI5 were part of the investigation. The prime minister, Theresa May, will chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency Cobra committee on Tuesday morning. A statement from 10 Downing Street confirmed that police are currently treating the incident at Manchester Arena as an \u201cappalling terrorist attack\u201d. Some very poignant observations from reporters at the scene. Many of those at the concert were children and teenagers. We are awaiting a fresh update from Greater Manchester police. In the meantime, here is what has been verified: At least 19 people have been killed and around 5o injured after an explosion at Manchester Arena at the end of a concert by Ariana Grande. The blast was reported to have taken place outside the arena, in the public foyer, shortly after 10.30pm. Investigators say they are treating the incident as a terrorist attack \u201cuntil police know otherwise\u201d. No identities of those killed or injured have been confirmed. A large area around the arena has been cordoned off. Victoria station has been closed and train services cancelled. A controlled explosion carried out by police in nearby Cathedral gardens turned out not to be suspicious. Prime minister Theresa May said: We are working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. Party leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Tim Farron also expressed condolences. Campaigning for June\u2019s general election has been suspended. Our North of England editor is at a hospital where the wounded are being treated: I\u2019ve just spoken to 17-year-old Ellie Ward with her mother outside Manchester Royal Infirmary. Her 64-year-old grandad was caught in the blast while waiting for her and her friend to come out of the concert. They said he was in the corridor by the merchandise stand in the tunnels underneath the tiered seating when he was hit by falling glass. Ellie said after visiting him: He\u2019s OK but he\u2019s cut his cheek, they said he had severed an artery. A lot of glass shattered on him. He said only realised what had happened when he felt the side of his head and it was bleeding. He was underneath the seats, by the merchandise, waiting for us to come out when we heard a massive shudder. We knew something was wrong. The prime minister has responded with a statement: We are working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. Police at the scene say there are still a lot of people in the area \u2013 the capacity of Manchester Arena is 21,000. Buses have been pressed into service to ferry people out of the area; some local taxi companies are also offering free rides for those affected. Rail services have been cancelled. The security minister, Ben Wallace, has called for vigilance. He calls the incident an attack; police have said they are treating it as possible terrorism, but we are waiting for confirmation. Wallace said: In the light of the attack in Manchester tonight, please be vigilant and if you see anything suspicious call the anti-terrorist hotline: 0800 789123. My thoughts are with all the victims of the incident tonight and our emergency services who are out there tending wounded and keeping us safe. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has tweeted his condolences: Facebook has activated its safety check for people who are at or near the arena to let family and friends know they are safe. Elena Semino, from Lancaster, was with her husband waiting for her daughter by the arena\u2019s ticket office when the explosion went off. She has a wound on her neck and her leg is bleeding. She hasn\u2019t been seen by a doctor yet as her priority was finding her daughter \u2013 which she now has. \u201cMy husband and I were standing against the wall, luckily, and all of a sudden there was this thing. I can\u2019t even describe it. There was this heat on my neck and when I looked up there were bodies everywhere.\u201d Her husband stayed behind to help an injured woman and has a minor injury. She ran to find her daughter in the auditorium. Semino\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Natalie and her friends said the performance had just come to an end when the explosion went off. \u201cIt went off and then there was a moment\u2019s silence and then there were screams,\u201d says Megan Ryder, 19. They say security guards initially tried to calm them down, saying it was a popped balloon or a technical difficulty. Here\u2019s a video in which it\u2019s possible to hear the controlled explosion carried out by Greater Manchester police on a suspicious device in Cathedral gardens, just minutes from the arena. Police have since confirmed that the item was abandoned clothing and now not thought to be suspicious. #RoomForManchester appears to have emerged on social media as the hashtag people are rallying around. It is an offer of spaces to stay the night for those who were at the concert who can\u2019t easily get home. Transport away from the area will be difficult, because Manchester Arena is right next to Manchester Victoria station, which, due to ongoing emergency service activity, has been closed. More eyewitness reports from our north of England reporter. The Guardian is not publishing the names of children involved: One 16-year-old boy says he and his two friends had come from Lincoln for this evening\u2019s show. They were sat next to the stage when they heard explosions as the performance came to an end. \u201cA lot of people are saying that there were two explosions, but we all heard three,\u201d he says. \u201cIt sounded like a gun shot. At first we thought it as a balloon, but then we felt the vibrations and stuff so we realised it wasn\u2019t a balloon. Our parents heard the explosion from [their] hotel.\u201d A 15-year-old girl tells the Guardian: \u201cThere were people falling over the chairs trying to get away and when we were running out we saw blood up the walls.\u201d Here is Tuesday\u2019s Guardian front page, reporting the news that 19 people have been killed: Greater Manchester police are warning people not to be alarmed as officers carry out a controlled explosion: A statement from Manchester Arena says the incident took place outside the venue \u2013 earlier reports had suggested it happened in the foyer. It\u2019s very common for details to be conflicting in the immediate aftermath of an incident like this; we will confirm as soon as we can. The statement reads: We can confirm there was an incident as people were leaving the Ariana Grande show last night. The incident took place outside the venue in a public space. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. Greater Manchester police have confirmed that 19 people have died and around 50 are injured: Just before 10.35pm on Monday 22 May 2017, police were called to reports of an explosion at Manchester Arena. So far 19 people have been confirmed dead, with around 50 others injured. This is currently being treated as a terrorist incident until police know otherwise. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far after the incident in Manchester this evening: Police have confirmed that at least 19 people have been killed in a suspected terror attack at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena. Officers said a further 50 were injured. One explosion was reported to have hit the foyer of the building at about 10:30pm, British Transport police said. Manchester Arena said the incident took place \u201coutside the venue in a public space\u201d. Multiple witnesses said they heard an explosion, with one telling the Guardian the blast shook the building. The North West counter-terrorism unit has said it is treating the incident as a possible terrorist attack. Our north of England reporter is at the scene: I\u2019m on Trinity Way, just around the corner from the arena. All roads into this part of the city have been blocked off, but there is still a small group of members of the public watching the police vans driving in and out. Some are wearing pyjamas and live in apartments in the area. They said they were woken by loud bangs of what they presumed were bombs going off. There are armed police standing by the corner of the road leading to the arena entrance and a bomb disposal van drove through the cordon about half an hour ago. Small groups of people who appear to have been at the concert have been emerging wrapped in blankets. One woman was shaking uncontrollably. I\u2019m picking up the live blog and we will continue to have rolling updates throughout the night. So far we know from Greater Manchester police that an unspecified number of people have been killed after what officers are calling a \u201cserious incident\u201d at the Manchester Arena, at the close of a concert by Ariana Grande. We will continue to have verified developments here. The ambulance service have warned people only to call \u201cfor life threatening emergencies\u201d and said a \u201clarge number of resources\u201d were at the incident. A barman at the nearby Steven Charles Snooker Club, who gave his name to the Press Association as Tyler, said he saw people lying on the ground covered in blood. We\u2019ve had a few people in with panic attacks and in all kinds of disarray. We\u2019ve got four girls here - trying to get them sorted to get picked up. There was a gentleman on the floor with his leg all bleeding and woman with blood down one side of her face. We felt something but didn\u2019t know what it was - there was a sound like thunder. One girl had a panic attack and another had streaming tears, a woman had a heart attack just outside. British Transport police officers are among those responding to the incident at Manchester Arena, following reports of an explosion within the foyer area of the arena at 10.30pm this evening. Emergency services are at the scene and we are working to establish more information regarding the explosion and will provide further updates as soon as possible. Jade Baynes, 18, from Hull, was told to run from the area by armed police after leaving the concert arena. She said she heard loud bangs and what sounded like gunshots just after the entertainment had finished. There were just a loud bang and a flash and everyone tried to scramble out. An alarm came on telling everyone to stay calm but leave as quickly as possible. Jade and her friend Jasmine Mia, 21, also from Hull, said there appeared to be some sort of commotion in the first tier of the arena, with a number of stewards stood around the seats. Armed police have now swamped the streets around the arena and police are moving members of the public away from the area. Greater Manchester police say that details of a casualty bureau will be available soon. We\u2019ll share them as soon as we get them. Footage showed lines of ambulances heading towards the venue, while a witness, Suzy Mitchell, said it appeared the main surrounding road had been closed. Oliver Jones, 17, was at the concert with his 19-year-old sister. I was in the toilet and heard a loud bang just after the concert had finished and people had started to leave. The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena and people started to run. I seen people running and screaming towards one direction and then many were turning around to run back the other way. Security was running out as well as the fans and concert goers. Reports of blood and people injured. In so much shock and panic. You see this on the news all the time and never expect it to happen to you. I just had to run and make sure me and my sister were safe. Erin McDougle, 20, from Newcastle said: \u201cThere was a loud bang at the end of the concert. The lights were already on so we knew it wasn\u2019t part of the show. At first we thought it was a bomb. There was a lot of smoke. People started running out. When we got outside the arena there were dozens of police vans and quite a few ambulances.\u201d A group of young men from Sheffield said they had seen at least five people covered in blood and others being carried out by bouncers. \u201cAriana Grande had just gone behind the curtain and the lights came up when there was this massive bang and a big cloud of smoke. I saw five people with blood all down them,\u201d said one. Sophie Tedd, 25, from Darlington, said the noise and smoke seemed to come from the tiered seating stage right. \u201cWe were sitting on that side then suddenly there was this big bang in the block next to us. Everyone started screaming and we nearly got trampled on. There was a burning smell.\u201d Police in Manchester confirm that an as-yet unspecified number of people have been killed in Manchester, as well as other injured. My colleague, Helen Pidd, is at the scene. She sends these updates: Majid Khan, 22, was also at the concert when the incident happened. He said: I and my sister, along with a lot of others were seeing Ariana Grande perform at Manchester Arena, and we were all exiting the venue when around 10.40-10.45pm-ish a huge bomb-like bang went off that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena. It was one bang and essentially everyone from the other side of the arena where the bang was heard from suddenly came running towards us as they were trying to exit Trinity Way and that was blocked so everyone was just running to any exit they could find as quickly as they could. Everyone was in a huge state of panic, calling each other as some had gone to the toilet whilst this had gone off, so it was just extremely disturbing for everyone there. Suzy Mitchell, 26, whose flat is opposite the venue, reported a huge bang rocking the neighbourhood. She told the Press Association: (I) just heard a huge bang from my bed, came out to the front of my apartments (we\u2019re on the top floor so have perfect view) and everyone was running away in big crowds. The bang was so big I heard it from my room which is at the back of the apartment blocks. Currently lots of emergency services going to and from. But can\u2019t see anything substantial as of yet except fleeing people and lots of cars. Police in Manchester have responded to a \u201cserious incident\u201d at the city\u2019s arena, amid unconfirmed reports online of an explosion. Greater Manchester police warned people to stay away from Manchester Arena while they dealt with the issue. Officers did not release any further details on what has happened. A concert by Ariana Grande was being staged at the time. Hannah Dane, who was at the concert, told the Guardian there was \u201cquite a loud explosion heard from inside the Manchester arena and it shook, then everyone screamed and tried to get out\u201d. She added: \u201cAs we got outside, lots of police came racing towards the area and the whole of the Victoria train station was surrounded by police.\u201d She said there were people \u201cscreaming and crying everywhere shouting that there\u2019s a bomb and also people were saying there\u2019s a shooter\u201d. Dane added that police were \u201cblocking off roads in the area. There are sirens zooming everywhere.\u201d",

As with the AV, Scottish independence and EU referendums and the 2010 and 2015 general elections, young people will vote overwhelmingly one way, as the rest of the country votes the other.</p> <p>This, we are told, is because 18- to 24-year-olds don\u2019t turn out in big enough numbers. All the \u201cvote 4 me bruv\u201d campaigning is entirely ineffective. Between 1992 and 2005, youth turnout at UK general elections declined by 28%, and has <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-2015\">hovered around the 40% mark</a> ever since. In local and European elections, youth turnout has been less than 20%, the lowest among the longest-standing 15 members of the EU.</p> <p>There is one ray of hope for the young. <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/government/whosWho/Academic%20profiles/mbruter@lseacuk/home.aspx\">Michael Bruter</a>, professor of political science at the London School of Economics, revealed last year that youth turnout in the EU referendum was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/09/young-people-referendum-turnout-brexit-twice-as-high\">almost double</a> the 36% that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyData/status/746700869656256512\">initially reported</a> using incorrect data. Indeed, turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds in that election was higher than in any vote in recent memory.</p> <p>Bruter is an important figure in the attempt to increase youth participation. His research involves huge multi-wave, multi-year, multi-mode surveys, as well as in-depth interviews, lab work and controlled experiments in democracies around the world, to try to work out what would get young people voting in the sorts of numbers they did in the 60s and 70s.</p> <p>He says the EU referendum bucked the trend because, while young people tend to be suspicious of elites and politicians, \u201cthey find it easier to get passionate about an issue than they do about a party\u201d. The problem is exacerbated in general elections because the main political parties are often not even interested in courting the youth vote. \u201cThere\u2019s little to motivate parties to make changes. It makes more sense for them to address the concerns of old voters rather than younger ones, who they consider not to vote in sufficient numbers. So young people feel like the political parties don\u2019t talk to them and as a result they vote less. It\u2019s a very bad vicious circle.\u201d</p> <p>This problem of youth abstention is often portrayed as a problem of communication. If only the parties used some more hashtags and some photo opportunities with grime stars (a tactic <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/JmeBBK/status/863777528288247808/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2Fmay%2F15%2Fthe-snap-jeremy-corbyn-tory-grab-labour-voters\">deployed by Jeremy Corbyn this week</a>), the young would come out and vote. \u201cAll the parties think the problem is that their message is not heard by young people. This is completely the wrong way of looking at things,\u201d says Bruter. \u201cThe problem is a problem of substance, not communication.\u201d Young people fully understand what the parties are offering, and are rejecting it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/08/snap-election-raises-risk-of-democratic-deficit-say-youth-vote-campaigners\">'Who will decide UK's future?': warning as funding for youth vote campaigns slashed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a more serious problem than we currently realise, he says. It is not just that young people are apathetic while they are young, but that society is creating generations of people who may never vote. \u201cIf young people don\u2019t vote for the first election of their lives, they\u2019re not likely to vote in later elections either,\u201d says Bruter. \u201cThey will be lost for good. If you give young people the impression that voting is not an effective way of channelling their frustration, then that frustration only increases and they feel that the policies are neither legitimate nor things that they need to obey. That is a very serious problem for democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Britain is not alone in facing this crisis: youth turnout across western democracies tends to be low, but there are a number of important exceptions we can learn from.</p> <p>One guarantee of higher turnout is an election where the stakes are perceived to be high: a meaningful change is on the ballot. Sometimes this happens because of a perceived threat, normally a far-right candidate: young people voted in high numbers in the second round of the French presidential election in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen was running, and in this year\u2019s Dutch election when anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders seemed to be in with a chance. But the stakes can also be raised by politicians projecting a grand vision to voters. \u201cWhen you talk to political parties about addressing young voters, the first thing that comes to mind is maybe we should lower university tuition fees and increase housing,\u201d says Bruter. \u201cThey try to give them freebies, or make their personal situation better. But voters in general are much more likely to vote for what they think is best for the country rather than what they think is best for themselves. It\u2019s about big ideas.\u201d</p> <p>Both Obama\u2019s historic presidential bid in 2008, and the 2015 <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-youth-turnout-2015-1.3636290\">Canadian federal election</a>, in which Justin Trudeau became Canadian prime minister, projected a positive political narrative about the future, and inspired higher-than-usual youth turnout. But the most unlikely upsurge of youth interest came in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/opinion/young-voters-motivated-again.html\">2016 US primary candidacy of Bernie Sanders</a>, who commanded as much as 80% of the youth vote in some states, and ensured, for the first time, that millennial voters formed as large a voting block as baby boomers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc1bdb3bc66e8e8cbe28681bfa1cbc28b7467293\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1bdb3bc66e8e8cbe28681bfa1cbc28b7467293/0_40_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Bernie Sanders in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYounger voters were looking for someone who wasn\u2019t afraid to talk about bigger ideas,\u201d says Keegan Goudiss, <a href=\"https://revolutionmessaging.com/team/keegan-goudiss\">a partner at Revolution Messaging</a> who served as director of digital advertising for the Bernie 2016 campaign. \u201cIn the Democratic party we\u2019ve had a problem where everyone keeps levering down the message to not scare off moderates or older voters, and Bernie said: \u2018I\u2019m not going to change what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m not going to water down my message.\u2019\u201d Sanders\u2019 broad themes of rising inequality in the US and the dangers of climate change turned his largely tokenistic primary run into a huge youth movement.</p> <p>Once you have a message that resonates with voters, you need to get it out there. Here, many parties believe they have found the panacea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/08/facebook-political-aides-campaigns-target-voters\">\u201cmicro-targeting\u201d</a>. Social networks such as Facebook let you directly reach young voters, creating bespoke adverts that will only be seen by them. Both Labour and the Conservatives are spending millions on this, but Goudiss is not impressed by their attempts. \u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake. If you\u2019re only targeting the 20% of people who like your message you\u2019re not inspiring the other 80%. What Bernie did differently was reach people on Facebook who, say, care about healthcare \u2013 that\u2019s a much bigger audience \u2013 and talk to them. Don\u2019t worry about if they\u2019re a certain demographic, if they\u2019re registered to vote, if they\u2019ve donated. Let\u2019s talk to them about a big idea that people care about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dbe3e558e2f5adec02891b15820bc4395d5855f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dbe3e558e2f5adec02891b15820bc4395d5855f/52_17_871_871/500.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders on Snapchat\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appealing to his audience: Bernie Sanders as he appeared to supporters on Snapchat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snapchat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed, much of what the Sanders campaign did went against social media orthodoxy: that posts have to be super-short and super-memorable. At the senator\u2019s behest, the campaign team made eight-minute social media videos, sent 2,500-word campaign emails, and filmed long, direct-to-camera speeches that were shared millions of times. They didn\u2019t try to hide Sanders\u2019 age; rather, they poked fun at it, with a cartoon Bernie appearing on dedicated Snapchat filters, only accessible at rallies, which were extremely popular with supporters under 24. They launched <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/artists/\">Artists for Bernie</a>, an organisation for musicians and artists to get involved in the campaign, not just with photo-ops, but thoughtful engagement and combined concert-rallies. In the space of six months, Bernie went from polling at 3% to beating Clinton in a number of important primary states, and coming close to being the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>In contrast, Corbyn has taken <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/jeremy-corbyn-is-now-on-snapchat\">a couple of Snapchats of local party meetings</a>, mostly from the wrong angle. At the time of writing, the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/conservatives/\">Conservatives</a> have 2,578 followers on their official Instagram.</p> <p>In Argentina, voting is compulsory, so the problem is not turnout but disillusion with politicians. By the 1990s, corruption was so high and trust in politicians so low that even the word \u201c<em>pol\u00edtica</em>\u201d was pejorative. There were even issues with people voting at random or for whoever was at the top of the ballot. So, at the start of the 2000s, groups and parties that supported the presidency of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner formed a coalition, now called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UyO.oficial/\">Unidos y Organizados</a> (United and Organised). It was a campaign group, not dissimilar to the Stop the War coalition, but it also did community outreach. Martina Rodriguez, who has been involved in the organisation since she was 15, tells me how they visited shanty towns across the country, read books with children, held breakfast clubs, and offered support and advice to local communities. They did all the things a charity would do, but they were there on behalf of the state.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/30/young-must-vote-general-election-8-june\">Can\u2019t be bothered to vote? If you\u2019re young, you simply can\u2019t afford not to</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The difference is a subtle one, but it has a big impact: imagine going to the jobcentre and finding the person at the centre was wearing a Labour T-shirt and telling you about what Labour policies could do for you. Over a decade, the supporters of President Kirchner built a movement of millions. Similar tactics have been used <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/democracy-rising-syriza-the-struggle-for-dignity-solidarity-and-the-rebirth-of-the-european-left/5428170\">by the radical left party Syriza in Greece</a>, which was involved in setting up health clinics, markets for fresh produce and educational classes. People start to see public services and politics as entirely intertwined, and politics as much bigger than parliament. Corbyn\u2019s plan for a huge Labour movement that is bigger than the political party perhaps has the potential to do something similar.</p> <p>If this all sounds like statist propaganda, it is. \u201cYes, the opposition said it was biased, that we were recruiting our own supporters,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cThere was obviously a sense of propaganda in everything we did. But it was needed. People fell in love with this project, it changed their lives \u2013 it let them go to university. That\u2019s not buying their support.\u201d</p> <p>During that time, many people in Argentina had moved from abject poverty to the middle class, but, Rodriguez says, unlike previous generations they thanked central government for this. Politicians were viewed as heroes.</p> <p>The results of this shift are most visible in Argentinian secondary schools, which have \u201cextremely active\u201d unions and political parties. \u201cStudents know everything about every party and every policy; even nine-year-olds have political opinions,\u201d says Sarah Raphael, who taught primary and secondary school classes in Buenos Aires. \u201cThere\u2019s a protest in the street literally every weekend \u2013 all the children know everything.\u201d</p> <p>The culmination of this engagement of the young was the lowering of the voting age in Argentina from 18 to 16. \u201cI was in congress the day the law was passed,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cIt was unbelievable. The gallery was filled with young people singing and chanting. It was so amazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00942caab42aa9eafa78f0a618641a08eb5dba78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00942caab42aa9eafa78f0a618641a08eb5dba78/0_197_5906_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman having face painted with a saltire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Scottish independence referendum saw 16-year-olds given the vote for the first time in the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Voting at 16 is more than just a way of inspiring young people, however. According to Bruter\u2019s research, it could transform youth participation in democracy, for mainly boring practical reasons. For most young people, their first opportunity to vote comes between the ages of 18 and 20, when they are likely to be downing pints in a student union bar or in Thailand on a gap year. Even if they re-register at a new address, they are unlikely to know the candidates or the local issues. \u201cBut when you are 16, you live in a place where you are likely to have grown up, you typically live with your parents, and you typically go to school, so you are socialised in an environment where you are aware of the state and aware of the election,\u201d Bruter says. The Scottish referendum was the first UK vote in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/15/scotland-voting-age-lowered-16-17\">the voting age was lowered to 16</a>. Estimates suggest 75% of 16- to 18-year-olds turned out, compared with 54% of 18- to 24-year-olds.</p> <p>There is another crucial change that Bruter has trialled at elections in more than six countries, with excellent results: make voting for the first time as important as other adolescent firsts, such as getting your driving licence, or losing your virginity. Bruter says that getting young people excited about voting for the first time has far more of an impact than guilting them into it. In studies, Bruter and his team have tried more than 30 different ways to make first-time voting more of a ceremony, from receiving an official notification by letter inviting you to vote \u201cfor the first time in your life\u201d, to dedicated polling stations and \u201chappy hours\u201d solely for first-time voters. All have been shown to improve voter turnout.</p> <p>What with young people constantly glued to their phones, you might think that electronic voting could make a difference, too. Indeed, it is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30234304\">currently being considered for the next UK general election</a>. But Bruter\u2019s research shows that people who e-vote are less satisfied with the experience than people who go to a polling station; experiments with 15-17 year olds in six different countries found internet voting was counter-productive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/19/tories-targeted-young-ballot-box-vote\">Tories have targeted the young. Go to the ballot box and take revenge | Abi Wilkinson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sobering truth is that the current UK election has almost none of the conditions that would engender a change. The stakes are extremely low, because everyone already believes their vote won\u2019t make a difference. The voting age is still 18, and the election is in June, when many students will have left university and may be away or at a festival. This week, the Electoral Reform Society reported that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/15/number-of-school-leavers-on-electoral-roll-in-england-falls-25\">number of school leavers on the electoral roll has dropped</a> by more than a quarter in three years. Most damningly, no party is articulating a big idea about the future of Britain; a message of citizenship, hope or change. All are focusing on transactional policies, trying to woo young people with free tuition fees or legalising cannabis. Even Labour, with its radical Berniesque leader, can struggle to imagine the future, offering piecemeal offerings such as \u201cmore bobbies on the beat\u201d in television and radio interviews.</p> <p>Yet there is still much to be hopeful about. All the main opposition parties support votes for 16- to 18-year-olds. Indeed, it is easy to imagine the sort of candidate, the sort of campaign, that could spark wild enthusiasm from young people. Perhaps Corbyn could even be that candidate if he could be persuaded to give up on the focus-tested giveaways and think more about the broad vision he wants to communicate to young voters. There were hints of that broader vision at the Labour manifesto launch this week, with the leader calling the document \u201ca draft for a better future\u201d. That is certainly more galvanising than Brian May tweeting as if he has got a bit part on <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/top-boy\">Top Boy</a>.</p>",

In local and European elections, youth turnout has been less than 20%, the lowest among the longest-standing 15 members of the EU. There is one ray of hope for the young. Michael Bruter, professor of political science at the London School of Economics, revealed last year that youth turnout in the EU referendum was almost double the 36% that was initially reported using incorrect data. Indeed, turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds in that election was higher than in any vote in recent memory. Bruter is an important figure in the attempt to increase youth participation. His research involves huge multi-wave, multi-year, multi-mode surveys, as well as in-depth interviews, lab work and controlled experiments in democracies around the world, to try to work out what would get young people voting in the sorts of numbers they did in the 60s and 70s. He says the EU referendum bucked the trend because, while young people tend to be suspicious of elites and politicians, \u201cthey find it easier to get passionate about an issue than they do about a party\u201d. The problem is exacerbated in general elections because the main political parties are often not even interested in courting the youth vote. \u201cThere\u2019s little to motivate parties to make changes. It makes more sense for them to address the concerns of old voters rather than younger ones, who they consider not to vote in sufficient numbers. So young people feel like the political parties don\u2019t talk to them and as a result they vote less. It\u2019s a very bad vicious circle.\u201d This problem of youth abstention is often portrayed as a problem of communication. If only the parties used some more hashtags and some photo opportunities with grime stars (a tactic deployed by Jeremy Corbyn this week), the young would come out and vote. \u201cAll the parties think the problem is that their message is not heard by young people. This is completely the wrong way of looking at things,\u201d says Bruter. \u201cThe problem is a problem of substance, not communication.\u201d Young people fully understand what the parties are offering, and are rejecting it. This is a more serious problem than we currently realise, he says. It is not just that young people are apathetic while they are young, but that society is creating generations of people who may never vote. \u201cIf young people don\u2019t vote for the first election of their lives, they\u2019re not likely to vote in later elections either,\u201d says Bruter. \u201cThey will be lost for good. If you give young people the impression that voting is not an effective way of channelling their frustration, then that frustration only increases and they feel that the policies are neither legitimate nor things that they need to obey. That is a very serious problem for democracy.\u201d Britain is not alone in facing this crisis: youth turnout across western democracies tends to be low, but there are a number of important exceptions we can learn from. One guarantee of higher turnout is an election where the stakes are perceived to be high: a meaningful change is on the ballot. Sometimes this happens because of a perceived threat, normally a far-right candidate: young people voted in high numbers in the second round of the French presidential election in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen was running, and in this year\u2019s Dutch election when anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders seemed to be in with a chance. But the stakes can also be raised by politicians projecting a grand vision to voters. \u201cWhen you talk to political parties about addressing young voters, the first thing that comes to mind is maybe we should lower university tuition fees and increase housing,\u201d says Bruter. \u201cThey try to give them freebies, or make their personal situation better. But voters in general are much more likely to vote for what they think is best for the country rather than what they think is best for themselves. It\u2019s about big ideas.\u201d Both Obama\u2019s historic presidential bid in 2008, and the 2015 Canadian federal election, in which Justin Trudeau became Canadian prime minister, projected a positive political narrative about the future, and inspired higher-than-usual youth turnout. But the most unlikely upsurge of youth interest came in the 2016 US primary candidacy of Bernie Sanders, who commanded as much as 80% of the youth vote in some states, and ensured, for the first time, that millennial voters formed as large a voting block as baby boomers. \u201cYounger voters were looking for someone who wasn\u2019t afraid to talk about bigger ideas,\u201d says Keegan Goudiss, a partner at Revolution Messaging who served as director of digital advertising for the Bernie 2016 campaign. \u201cIn the Democratic party we\u2019ve had a problem where everyone keeps levering down the message to not scare off moderates or older voters, and Bernie said: \u2018I\u2019m not going to change what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m not going to water down my message.\u2019\u201d Sanders\u2019 broad themes of rising inequality in the US and the dangers of climate change turned his largely tokenistic primary run into a huge youth movement. Once you have a message that resonates with voters, you need to get it out there. Here, many parties believe they have found the panacea, \u201cmicro-targeting\u201d. Social networks such as Facebook let you directly reach young voters, creating bespoke adverts that will only be seen by them. Both Labour and the Conservatives are spending millions on this, but Goudiss is not impressed by their attempts. \u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake. If you\u2019re only targeting the 20% of people who like your message you\u2019re not inspiring the other 80%. What Bernie did differently was reach people on Facebook who, say, care about healthcare \u2013 that\u2019s a much bigger audience \u2013 and talk to them. Don\u2019t worry about if they\u2019re a certain demographic, if they\u2019re registered to vote, if they\u2019ve donated. Let\u2019s talk to them about a big idea that people care about.\u201d Indeed, much of what the Sanders campaign did went against social media orthodoxy: that posts have to be super-short and super-memorable. At the senator\u2019s behest, the campaign team made eight-minute social media videos, sent 2,500-word campaign emails, and filmed long, direct-to-camera speeches that were shared millions of times. They didn\u2019t try to hide Sanders\u2019 age; rather, they poked fun at it, with a cartoon Bernie appearing on dedicated Snapchat filters, only accessible at rallies, which were extremely popular with supporters under 24. They launched Artists for Bernie, an organisation for musicians and artists to get involved in the campaign, not just with photo-ops, but thoughtful engagement and combined concert-rallies. In the space of six months, Bernie went from polling at 3% to beating Clinton in a number of important primary states, and coming close to being the Democratic nominee. In contrast, Corbyn has taken a couple of Snapchats of local party meetings, mostly from the wrong angle. At the time of writing, the Conservatives have 2,578 followers on their official Instagram. In Argentina, voting is compulsory, so the problem is not turnout but disillusion with politicians. By the 1990s, corruption was so high and trust in politicians so low that even the word \u201cpol\u00edtica\u201d was pejorative. There were even issues with people voting at random or for whoever was at the top of the ballot. So, at the start of the 2000s, groups and parties that supported the presidency of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner formed a coalition, now called Unidos y Organizados (United and Organised). It was a campaign group, not dissimilar to the Stop the War coalition, but it also did community outreach. Martina Rodriguez, who has been involved in the organisation since she was 15, tells me how they visited shanty towns across the country, read books with children, held breakfast clubs, and offered support and advice to local communities. They did all the things a charity would do, but they were there on behalf of the state. The difference is a subtle one, but it has a big impact: imagine going to the jobcentre and finding the person at the centre was wearing a Labour T-shirt and telling you about what Labour policies could do for you. Over a decade, the supporters of President Kirchner built a movement of millions. Similar tactics have been used by the radical left party Syriza in Greece, which was involved in setting up health clinics, markets for fresh produce and educational classes. People start to see public services and politics as entirely intertwined, and politics as much bigger than parliament. Corbyn\u2019s plan for a huge Labour movement that is bigger than the political party perhaps has the potential to do something similar. If this all sounds like statist propaganda, it is. \u201cYes, the opposition said it was biased, that we were recruiting our own supporters,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cThere was obviously a sense of propaganda in everything we did. But it was needed. People fell in love with this project, it changed their lives \u2013 it let them go to university. That\u2019s not buying their support.\u201d During that time, many people in Argentina had moved from abject poverty to the middle class, but, Rodriguez says, unlike previous generations they thanked central government for this. Politicians were viewed as heroes. The results of this shift are most visible in Argentinian secondary schools, which have \u201cextremely active\u201d unions and political parties. \u201cStudents know everything about every party and every policy; even nine-year-olds have political opinions,\u201d says Sarah Raphael, who taught primary and secondary school classes in Buenos Aires. \u201cThere\u2019s a protest in the street literally every weekend \u2013 all the children know everything.\u201d The culmination of this engagement of the young was the lowering of the voting age in Argentina from 18 to 16. \u201cI was in congress the day the law was passed,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cIt was unbelievable. The gallery was filled with young people singing and chanting. It was so amazing.\u201d Voting at 16 is more than just a way of inspiring young people, however. According to Bruter\u2019s research, it could transform youth participation in democracy, for mainly boring practical reasons. For most young people, their first opportunity to vote comes between the ages of 18 and 20, when they are likely to be downing pints in a student union bar or in Thailand on a gap year. Even if they re-register at a new address, they are unlikely to know the candidates or the local issues. \u201cBut when you are 16, you live in a place where you are likely to have grown up, you typically live with your parents, and you typically go to school, so you are socialised in an environment where you are aware of the state and aware of the election,\u201d Bruter says. The Scottish referendum was the first UK vote in which the voting age was lowered to 16. Estimates suggest 75% of 16- to 18-year-olds turned out, compared with 54% of 18- to 24-year-olds. There is another crucial change that Bruter has trialled at elections in more than six countries, with excellent results: make voting for the first time as important as other adolescent firsts, such as getting your driving licence, or losing your virginity. Bruter says that getting young people excited about voting for the first time has far more of an impact than guilting them into it. In studies, Bruter and his team have tried more than 30 different ways to make first-time voting more of a ceremony, from receiving an official notification by letter inviting you to vote \u201cfor the first time in your life\u201d, to dedicated polling stations and \u201chappy hours\u201d solely for first-time voters. All have been shown to improve voter turnout. What with young people constantly glued to their phones, you might think that electronic voting could make a difference, too. Indeed, it is currently being considered for the next UK general election. But Bruter\u2019s research shows that people who e-vote are less satisfied with the experience than people who go to a polling station; experiments with 15-17 year olds in six different countries found internet voting was counter-productive. The sobering truth is that the current UK election has almost none of the conditions that would engender a change. The stakes are extremely low, because everyone already believes their vote won\u2019t make a difference. The voting age is still 18, and the election is in June, when many students will have left university and may be away or at a festival. This week, the Electoral Reform Society reported that the number of school leavers on the electoral roll has dropped by more than a quarter in three years. Most damningly, no party is articulating a big idea about the future of Britain; a message of citizenship, hope or change. All are focusing on transactional policies, trying to woo young people with free tuition fees or legalising cannabis. Even Labour, with its radical Berniesque leader, can struggle to imagine the future, offering piecemeal offerings such as \u201cmore bobbies on the beat\u201d in television and radio interviews. Yet there is still much to be hopeful about. All the main opposition parties support votes for 16- to 18-year-olds. Indeed, it is easy to imagine the sort of candidate, the sort of campaign, that could spark wild enthusiasm from young people. Perhaps Corbyn could even be that candidate if he could be persuaded to give up on the focus-tested giveaways and think more about the broad vision he wants to communicate to young voters. There were hints of that broader vision at the Labour manifesto launch this week, with the leader calling the document \u201ca draft for a better future\u201d. That is certainly more galvanising than Brian May tweeting as if he has got a bit part on Top Boy.",

Like Mum Ivana, she did some modelling before joining the family business and rising to becoming executive vice-president and, everyone agrees, Daddy\u2019s favourite. She was with him on his famous TV show, too. Today, she is assistant to the president. Assistant, possibly apprentice, now that the presidency is something between a family business and a gameshow.</p> <p>Those Donald-Ivanka clips are not just peak weird-Trump, they\u2019re some of the creepiest television ever, aren\u2019t they? What do the two of them have in common, they are asked. \u201cReal estate and golf,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, I was going to say sex,\u201d says Donald. (What does he even mean?) And: \u201cI\u2019ve said that if Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter perhaps I\u2019d be dating her.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs. Instead of shouting: \u201cDad! No! That is so inappropriate!\u201d, which would be a better response. Or, as he seems to suggest that he has said it before, calling 911. Frei is not really helping by asking if she is \u201csimply a fig leaf for her father\u2019s policies\u201d \u2013 now I\u2019ve got a picture of Donald, nude, orange all over, with his \u201cpolicies\u201d covered by his daughter. Eurgh, God, I\u2019m sorry.</p> <p>Frei has assembled a reasonable bunch: writers and journalists, academics, a psychologist, a rabbi, neighbours, fundraisers for, campaigners against, antis and pros. They say that Ivanka embodies the conflict of interest that poisons this administration, she\u2019s being used as a tool to whitewash his behaviour, she\u2019s his best weapon, he couldn\u2019t have been elected without her, she softens the edges, her conversion to Judaism in order to marry Jared Kushner shows dedication, she\u2019s beautiful, successful, graceful, a champion of women, LGBT rights and climate change, even \u2026</p> <p>Actually, she gets a reasonably easy ride. So, for example, we see the look of surprise on Christine Lagarde\u2019s face, surprise perhaps that Ivanka is on a panel with her and Angela Merkel at a women\u2019s summit. But we don\u2019t hear the jeers from the audience as Ivanka defends her father\u2019s treatment of women. And I wanted more \u2013 some serious (psycho)analysis \u2013 on The Weirdness, the odd father-daughter relationship and her apparent acceptance of it. And the thing he does when he introduces her to a rally crowd: \u201cI\u2019m sure most of you have never heard of her,\u201d and: \u201cHas anyone heard of Ivanka Trump?\u201d What\u2019s that about?</p> <p>What about the actual first lady, Melania? Invisible. \u201cShe seems to have gone into a witness protection programme,\u201d say Frei. Or to Guant\u00e1namo, maybe? The colour of her jumpsuit a cruel reminder of her husband\u2019s face \u2026</p> <p>Anyway, this isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about Ivanka. A Princeton prof, <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~jzelizer/\">Julian Zelizer</a>, makes most sense; he says her influence is significant \u201cbecause we have a president who doesn\u2019t know what he is supposed to do\u201d. And then, on the possibility of an Ivanka presidency: \u201cWe have to imagine everyone can run for presidency at this point.\u201d</p> <p>So, in the<a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/831270847671316483/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F\"> photo</a> of her with her father and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in the Oval Office, her in the president\u2019s chair, is she trying it out for size? \u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d says Frei. \u201cAmerica loves a dynasty.\u201d</p> <p>Why stop there, then? Back to the quiz. A bit trickier this time: the second female US president? Arabella Rose Kushner, daughter of \u201cJavanka\u201d? Good guess, but unfortunately Arabella didn\u2019t have the right surname, the one emblazoned on the White House (we\u2019re in the future, remember).
