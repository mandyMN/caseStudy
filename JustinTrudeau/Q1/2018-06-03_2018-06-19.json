That is the <em>minimum</em> number of oil tankers; it could be more. A single incident would render the beautiful beaches of the city, surrounding islands and Vancouver Island uninhabitable.

          "bodyText": "While those who follow the daily thrust and parry of Australian politics may get het up over the veracity of Treasury modelling of dividend imputation, it can seem like easy listening when compared to the fire and fury that is US politics. Eighteen months into the Trump presidency, it\u2019s as if the Americans have created a new genre of amplified conflict, where nothing makes sense unless it can be reduced to a tweet. So after a week when the US President declared his trade allies the enemy and a communist dictator a man of honour, what are Australians making of the global circus? According to this week\u2019s Essential Report, Australians watched the events in Singapore where Trump and Kim Jong-un summoned in a new era of photo opportunities with a degree of scepticism. While our government was ready to offer the US President bouquets for brokering the denuclearisation talks and, presumably, setting a new standard in diplomatic video production values, the public is less certain. Only 35% of our respondents thought that the engagement would make the world a safer place, a majority thought the meeting would make no difference, or haven\u2019t registered a view on the matter. These findings speak to a general sense of reticence about our engagement with the rest of the world. We regularly ask a set of questions about whether people think it\u2019s important for Australia to have a close relationship with other nations and what I find most interesting is our collective comfort with the status quo. First, despite our increasing economic engagement with our region, it is the traditional connection to the USA and UK that still are seen as being the most important. But more striking to me is that even here no relationship gets above a bare majority response of being \u201cvery important\u201d. Instead, nations like China, Japan, India and Indonesia are seen as \u201cquite important\u201d, a lukewarm middle ground in our international consciousness. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that Trump\u2019s shenanigans are drowning out the rest of the global interactions, after all most of these nations had much higher levels of engagement when we first started polling this series in 2011. When international relations becomes another part of the reality show, maybe it\u2019s natural for us to take our place in the cheap seats and watch, ignoring the complex global web we are part of. Or maybe the Trump presidency is having a more profound influence and reducing politics down to a series of personal interactions, with world leaders becoming characters who are booked for guest appearances on the global stage. If this is happening, then the good news is that Australians clearly prefer our democrats, notably our liberal ones, from our dictators. Indeed New Zealand PM, Jacinta Adern, and Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 the world leaders that Trump mistook for a power couple \u2013 emerge as the leaders we most admire. These are closely followed by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, the keepers of a European democratic tradition that Trump is increasingly seeing as a challenge to his own agenda. Then we see a big jump to Trump at 22% favourable, 64% unfavourable; not far in public regard from the two dictators he has recently lavished with his high regard. It is worth noting that Trump\u2019s favourability is much high among people who identify as voting outside the established three political groups (Coalition, Labor and Greens), but even these outsiders can only rustle a tad of a third support. Despite Clive Palmer\u2019s latest foray into billboard marketing, these results suggest that Australians are comfortable with the idea of being led by democratically inclined, slightly boring centrists. Long may the battle over dividend imputation credits rage. Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential and a Guardian Australia columnist",

Asked whether they preferred the Turnbull government\u2019s plan of providing tax relief up the income scales, or Labor\u2019s plan of a larger rebate for the lower end and higher taxes at the top of the scale \u2013 50% of the sample backed the Labor alternative. All income groups surveyed favoured the Labor alternative, even those earning more than $2,000 a week, by a margin of 50% to 36%. Since the same question was asked just after budget week, there has been a five-point shift in Labor\u2019s favour. The government\u2019s plan to cut taxes for Australia\u2019s largest corporations also continues to divide the Guardian Essential sample, with 39% in favour and 39% opposed, and voters divided on partisan lines. Coalition voters were more inclined to support the proposal (56% support/28% oppose) while Labor voters were more likely to oppose it (29% support/51% oppose). With critical byelection contests under way in several states and the results on 28 July important to both major party leaders, the new poll shows the Coalition has rebounded slightly from a slide in voter support captured during the renewed furore about the private travails of the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce that coincided with a paid interview on the Seven Network. Joyce\u2019s headline domination correlated with a four-point drop in the Coalition\u2019s primary vote, which saw Labor extend its long term opinion poll lead over the Coalition to 54% to 46% on the two-party preferred measure a fortnight ago. With the Joyce sideshow currently minimised, the gap between the major parties has narrowed again, with Labor still in front on the two-party-preferred measure 52% to 48%. The Coalition\u2019s primary vote improved by two points (38%) and Labor\u2019s primary vote fell by two points (35%). The Guardian Essential poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus three points. Survey respondents were also asked about ABC funding \u2013 with the national broadcaster back in the headlines again after government complaints about the conduct of various ABC journalists, and the Liberal party\u2019s peak council voting overwhelmingly on the weekend to privatise the ABC. There was support for funding increases to the ABC for local content and film production and for emergency broadcasts. More voters supported maintaining current funding levels for local news, news and current affairs, and children\u2019s content rather than increasing the current budgets. There were also questions about Australia\u2019s international alliances given the past fortnight was dominated by Donald Trump\u2019s arguments with traditional allies and with his rapprochement with North Korea. The North Korean summit divided Australian voters \u2013 35% thought the agreement between Trump and Kim Jong-un would make the world safer, 8% thought less safe and 41% thought it would make no difference. Respondents were asked about their views of various world leaders. New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern and Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau got the thumbs up from more than half the sample (54%). Coalition voters were more likely to have a favourable view of British prime minister Theresa May (55%), French president Emmanuel Macron (51%), and Trump (30%). Labor voters were keen on Ardern (61% favourable). The main changes since the questions were last asked a year ago was increased favourability for May (up 9%) and Trump (up 6%). Half the survey believes the US alliance is important for Australia, while 47% think it is important to have a close relationship with the UK and 39% with China. Coalition voters are more positive about the importance of the US alliance than Labor and the Greens. Since this question was last asked, people are warmer about Australia\u2019s alliance with the US, and cooler on Australia\u2019s relationship with China and Germany (down 4%).",

Cameron, who is 40, runs a psychotherapy practice nearby.</p> <p>To start off, Joe, a slight man in a hoodie, volunteered a story about how he came to realize that vulnerability was a strength rather than weakness.</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019ve never shared this in front of a group before,\u201d said Joe, 34, who told us the story of his mother passing away when he was three; how his dad became hardened and distant; and how, at the age of 27, he found himself in deep depression.</p> <p>\u201cI was single, in a job I hated, with very few friends I could count on. I felt like we are all going to die anyways, so what\u2019s the purpose of trying?\u201d</p> <p>Uncovering blocked emotions, Joe told us, saved his life. </p> <p>\u201cI realized if I wasn\u2019t going to take my life, I had to go back in time and work through my feelings. I was a 27-year-old living in a little boy\u2019s trauma. I needed to prove to myself that it was safe to feel again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>'Conversations with other men are usually very superficial.

(Some of the participants declined to be named for this story.) \u201cLike, \u2018Oh, I got laid last night\u2019. It gets boring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only fucking boring, it\u2019s unhealthy,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cMost men suffer alone.\u201d</p> <p>The discussion shifted to the meaning of anger.</p> <p>\u201cI played football growing up and I learned that, as a man, you kept things inside so you could use them as a weapon. But emotions are energy and they have to move, they have to be released,\u201d said Chris, who recently returned from a chakra retreat in Belize. Many men never learn \u201chow to release that energy without using force\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAnger is like an iceberg,\u201d Alex Cameron, the therapist leading the session, told us. \u201cAnger is what you see, but it comes from everything else below the surface \u2013 shame, fear, guilt. For most men, it feels safer to get angry than express sadness or vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>He wrapped up on a more personal note. \u201cWhen I feel vulnerable, I cry. It looks like sadness on the outside, but it feels powerful.\u201d</p> <h2> Liberation from boys being boys</h2> <p>I\u2019ve dropped in on The Huddle several times over the past six months. One meeting focused on mental health and substance abuse; a former drug addict shared the story of his attempted suicide and recent recovery. Another served as a #MeToo confessional. \u201cI bet every man in here has a story about how they\u2019ve mistreated a woman,\u201d the facilitator prodded. After a deafening silence, one man threw up his hands. \u201cI know I\u2019ve done some foul shit.\u201d </p> <p>I met a Reiki healer, a construction worker, a former professional soccer player, a gym owner, a bartender, and several social workers. The group appeared to attract mainly straight, unmarried men in their thirties who share interest in fashion, athletics, and wellness trends; the tattoo quotient of the participants was high. In a nation, and a neighborhood, that is predominantly white, The Huddle crowd skews about 50% black. </p> <p>Lululemon\u2019s dive into the murk of modern masculinity is a hipster-approved strand in a longer lineage of male reckoning.</p> <p>Alongside the din of women\u2019s lib in the late 1960s was the lesser known men\u2019s liberation movement. \u201cMale liberation calls for men to free themselves from the sex role stereotypes that limit their ability to be human,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/33743560/On_Male_Liberation\">wrote</a> psychologist Jack Sawyer, an early proponent, in a 1970 issue of Liberation magazine. \u201cThe battle of women to be free need not be a battle against men as oppressors. The choice about whether men are the enemy is up to men themselves.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>As a man, you kept things inside so you could use them as a weapon. But emotions are energy and they have to move</p> <footer> <cite>Chris, at The Huddle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today the pro-feminist men\u2019s movement champions causes ranging from reducing violence against women to raising awareness about male suicide and prostate cancer. Adherents dwell in gender studies programs, social justice groups, and mental health organizations\u2014and in small groups of men who gather in coffee shops and living rooms for heartfelt talk. </p> <p>Pro-feminist masculinity has remained relatively obscure, though #MeToo may be changing that.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s allowed male feminists like myself to come out of the shadows,\u201d Michael Kehler, a University of Calgary masculinities studies professor, told me by phone. His career, after two decades of \u201cquiet, diligent work to move this agenda forward,\u201d has flowered with media requests and speaking engagements. In January, Kehler became North America\u2019s first masculinities studies research chair. </p> <p>\u201cUntil recently, there was an allowance, or even an expectation, for men to behave badly, like it was a natural way of being,\u201d Kehler said. \u201c[I]t was written off as \u2018boys being boys\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s just locker room talk\u2019. If you didn\u2019t talk about sports or engage in sexualizing banter, other men might question the adequacy of your masculinity.\u201d </p> <p>Kehler believes this older breed of masculinity is dying. Some evidence, however, suggests otherwise.</p> <p>Pro-feminist men feel that by modulating hypermasculinity, and ceding a wider wedge of societal power to women, they can clear a path to male enlightenment \u2013 something good for men and women. </p> <p>But a countermovement has gained steam.</p> <p>Known as the men\u2019s rights movement, these ad-hoc, mainly internet-based activists are resistant to policies promoting women\u2019s equality and to the men-as-oppressors narrative generally. Oddly enough, the movement\u2019s ideological godfather, Warren Farrell, was a well-known male feminist in the seventies who marched alongside Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. By the time Farrell\u2019s 1993 book The Myth of Male Power arrived on shelves, his metamorphosis was complete: \u201cWhat we, as feminists, did is put men into the oppressor class and called it patriarchy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a15964/honey-badgers-mens-rights-movement/\">he once said</a> of his previous self.</p> <p>While some strands of the men\u2019s rights movement tout their efforts to provide <a href=\"https://menandfamilies.org/\">men\u2019s shelters</a>, male-centric mental health services, and legal support in paternity cases, others are openly misogynist.</p> <p>\u201cPussy is the only real empowerment women will ever know,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy\">wrote</a> Paul Elam, the founder of AVoiceForMen.com, to promote the website\u2019s \u201cslap-a-violent-bitch month\u201d in 2017. \u201cPut all the hopelessly wishful thinking of feminist ideology aside and what remains is the fact that it is men and pretty much men only who draw power from accomplishment, who invent technology, build nations, cure disease, create empires and generally advance civilization.\u201d</p> <p> Elam\u2019s online community has been <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/these-mens-rights-groups-are-now-listed-as-hate-groups.html\">deemed a hate group</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p> <p>ReturnOfKings.com, a blog for \u201cpickup artists\u201d (men focused on manipulating women into sex), has also earned this distinction. The website\u2019s founder, Daryush Valizadeh, even suggested rape should be legal \u201cif done on private property\u201d.</p> <p> Also in the constellation of men\u2019s rights groups are \u201cincels\u201d \u2013 men who blame women for their inability to attract a mate. (The word is a contraction of \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d.) The online subculture reached notoriety in April when 25-year-old Alek Minassian drove into two dozen pedestrians in Toronto. Eight of the 10 killed were women. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/us/incel-rebellion-alek-minassian-toronto-attack-trnd/index.html\">The Incel Rebellion has already begun,</a>\u201d Minassian posted on Facebook moments before he rammed his rental van into a Yonge Street sidewalk.</p> <h2>\u2018Black kids can\u2019t afford therapy - we have to fix ourselves\u2019</h2> <p>Jahmal Padmore, one of the organizers of The Huddle, believes that blaming women, or anyone, does not dissolve one\u2019s woes so much as harden them. </p> <p>The bespectacled, well-muscled 34-year-old gently badgers his male friends to show up for The Huddle because he knows firsthand how difficult it is to reach out for support.<br></p> <p> \u201cBlack kids can\u2019t afford therapy \u2013 if we\u2019re going to get fixed, we have to do it ourselves,\u201d Padmore, the son of Antiguan immigrants, told me. \u201cSo I just went on YouTube and watched a lot of personal development videos.\u201d </p> <p>Padmore\u2019s craving for self-discovery accelerated as he approached his 30th birthday. He was drinking heavily and had some brushes with mental illness. One day he came across a series of videos by the University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson, focused on men\u2019s pain.

I love that, that\u2019s real, that\u2019s what a lot of young men are looking for. When guys are maturing and coming to terms with the fact that they\u2019re not going to be an NBA star, or whatever dreams or expectations they had aren\u2019t being fulfilled, it can be painful. And because we\u2019re men, we\u2019re socialized to not express those feelings of frustration in a healthy way.\u201d</p> <p>In the early 2010s, the eccentric professor was known for TedX talks with innocuous, New Age titles like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLteWutitFM\">Potential</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOgSqHtTtHY\">Redefining Reality</a>\u201d. But Peterson also had a reputation for blistering attacks on male laziness \u2013 \u201cClean up your room!\u201d he often barks at his young followers \u2013 and criticizing political correctness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem I have with Jordan Peterson is that finding your personal [capabilities] comes at the expense of others</p> <footer> <cite>Jahmal Padmore</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2016 Peterson\u2019s viral popularity exploded after he protested Bill C-16, legislation adding gender identity to the characteristics protected by Canadian anti-discrimination law. The publication of his book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos in January this year vaulted Peterson into international stardom.</p> <p>While Peterson maintains the persona of a self-help guru styled as a stern but loving father figure \u2013 \u201cTo stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,\u201d he writes \u2013 the threads of intolerance in his work, and the rhetoric of some of his followers, teeter toward hate.</p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life.html\">New York Times profile</a>, Peterson surmised that the Toronto van attacker \u201cwas angry at God because women were rejecting him\u201d. He suggested \u201cenforced monogamy\u201d as a societal cure for incels and other disgruntled young men. Peterson has never hidden his view that women should submit to conventional gender roles, but in May he published a chummy 90-minute interview with Warren Farrell, cementing his affinity with the men\u2019s rights movement.</p> <p>Padmore sensed these threads years before they were making headlines. \u201cThe problem I have with Jordan Peterson and his ilk is that, for them, finding your personal [capabilities] comes at the expense of others. I have a huge issue with the tendency to blame women and trans people and anyone that doesn\u2019t conform. Go deep, try to find out more about yourself \u2013 of course \u2013 but don\u2019t drag other people down.\u201d </p> <p>Another reason he quickly fell from the orbit of Peterson\u2019s charisma: \u201cI\u2019m black.\u201d</p> <p>Peterson\u2019s fan base, which is 84 % male according to the data analytics firm Zoomph, is well-steeped in racist alt-right culture.

She referred me to an article urging women to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.flare.com/news/lululemon-ceo/\">drop [their] Lululemon obsession</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Lululemon\u2019s founder, Chip Wilson, once suggested that breast cancer rates rose in the nineties because of \u201ccigarette-smoking Power Women who were on the pill\u2026and taking on the stress previously left to men in the working world\u201d. He <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/lululemon-plus-size_n_3675605\">said</a> that Lululemon clothing was not for plus-sized or even average-sized women. In 2015, after being forced to recall a number of yoga pants with a conspicuous defect \u2013 they became see-through in the crotch after a short period of use \u2013 Wilson <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/lululemon-founder-chip-wilson-resigns-2015-2\">resigned</a>.</p> <p>In 2016, a supervisor at a Lululemon in California was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/suit-claims-lululemon-supervisor-raped-worker.html\">accused of raping a female co-worker</a>. The victim\u2019s lawsuit painted the company as a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/leticiamiranda/lululemon-athletica-ceo-resigns-after-conduct-issue?utm_term=.ba502ye55#.htEqlAvXX\">haven for sexual predators</a> \u2013 a place, BuzzFeed wrote, \u201cwhere women are encouraged to wear tight clothes to work, lewd comments go unchecked, and hookups between bosses and subordinates are accepted as par for the course after a wild night of drinking\u201d.<br></p> <p>This February, Wilson\u2019s replacement as CEO, Laurent Potdevin, was also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/lululemon-ceo-laurent-potdevin-had-inappropriate-employee-relationship.html\">forced out</a> for misconduct, possibly because of a relationship with a subordinate. (Further details have not yet emerged.)</p> <p>When I contacted Lululemon headquarters to ask how the company reconciled its brand identity as a beacon of yogic enlightenment with its reputation as a bastion of toxic masculinity, a PR rep supplied me with a statement attributed to Ben Stubbington, senior vice president of men\u2019s design:</p> <p>\u201cAt Lululemon we \u2018live in practice\u2019. This is translated literally on the yoga mat and also in all ways we walk in life. [\u2026] As the definitions of masculinity constantly evolve in society, we embrace deconstructing its traditional confines, working to the principle that addressing vulnerability is a strength and has immense power to give back.\u201d</p> <p>Padmore, unwilling to defend the company, took a more prosaic stance. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly concerned with Lululemon\u2019s past, present, or future image; I\u2019m concerned with showing up and doing things that impact people\u2019s lives in a positive way.\u201d He said he hasn\u2019t seen any signs of a culture of toxic masculinity at the company since being hired a year ago.</p> <p>The righteous aren\u2019t immune to hypocrisy, he added. \u201cI think a lot of liberal white folks get caught up in perfection. You\u2019re going to make mistakes, you\u2019re going to fuck up. But I think you have to be okay with that and keep pushing forward.\u201d</p> <p>If the various men\u2019s movement subcultures are in competition for followers, the pro-feminist folks are losing badly. Jordan Peterson has 1.2 million followers on YouTube and more than 700,000 on Twitter. Prominent pro-feminist male personalities count four or five digits at most.</p> <p>Jeff Perera, a figure in Toronto\u2019s pro-feminist men\u2019s community, told me he hasn\u2019t won any converts from the Peterson camp, but has occasionally lost friends who \u201cconverted to the other side\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe put out a lot of statistics about the unfortunate realities women go through, which are important for men to hear,\u201d Perera said. \u201cThe problem is a lot of men don\u2019t want to hear some expert telling them what a shitty person they are. They\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, I wasn\u2019t planning on raping anyone today, so peace out\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Around the time Trump was elected, Perera, 42, worked part-time for <a href=\"https://nextgenmen.ca/\">Next Gen Men</a>, a non-profit that works with teenage boys to get them thinking outside the gender box. During one afterschool program at an elite prep school outside Toronto, the conversation, Perera recalled, turned to the new US president.</p> <p>\u201cI described him as the \u2018televangelist of toxic masculinity\u2019. I said to the guys, \u2018He\u2019s like Cobra Commander from GI Joe \u2013 he has to have his supervillain logo on everything from his helicopter to his evil headquarters at Trump Tower\u2019. One of the boys looked at me with kind of a deadpan stare, and was like, \u2018That\u2019s actually kind of cool\u2019. It was this moment where I had a crisis of faith. I realized that the movement is failing.\u201d</p> <p>The coolness quotient of the pro-feminist men\u2019s world, at least in the eyes of the average adolescent male, is rather low. Attendees of the annual conference put on by the National Organization of Men Against Sexism are likely to be treated to rousing renditions of songs like \u201cLet the Woman In You Come Through\u201d or \u201cWomb Envy\u201d. One can imagine howls of laughter from 16-year-olds forced to sing along to \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Wee-Wee, So What\u2019s the Big Deal?\u201d</p> <p>Which is why it may not be a bad thing for a trendy, globally recognized brand, however imperfect, to take up the torch.</p> <p>Jian Pablico, who originated The Huddle at Lululemon\u2019s Vancouver headquarters, told me his role as a \u201cmindful performance manager\u201d is to \u201ccurate\u201d non-traditional masculinity for \u201cmen who may not be part of that culture yet\u201d. That\u2019s why the touchy-feely talks are held only one day a month.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to find a way to bring people together who might be hesitant about showing up for a conversation on vulnerability,\u201d Pablico said. \u201cSweating together first helps it come naturally. Once you suffer together in a workout, you begin to bond and a layer of the mask comes off. It\u2019s then a little easier to chat afterwards over a beer. Or a kombucha.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jordan Peterson views feminism as an emasculating force. He believes men ought to be allowed to be unapologetically tough, ambitious, competitive, and forceful.</p> <p>But no one in the pro-feminist camp has really suggested that men can\u2019t be tough, ambitious, competitive, or forceful \u2013 only that it is unhealthy to suppress other ways of being.</p> <p>After his Huddle session on emotional literacy, Alex Cameron, the therapist, showed me his tattoos. I\u2019d assumed they were a relic from some previous life as a bouncer or lumberjack. It turns out he got them on graduating his master\u2019s in social work. One arm depicts a dragon, symbol of virility; the other, a phoenix, which in Chinese mythology signifies feminine grace.\u201cWe have opposing sides within us,\u201d Cameron said. Harmony, he believes, must come from \u201cembracing our entire self\u201d.</p>",

          "bodyText": "On a warm Tuesday evening, a dozen men gathered on couches at a Lululemon location in Toronto called The Local. Since last year, as an experiment to reach more male customers, the store has been home to The Huddle, a male bonding group which meets Tuesday nights after closing to work out, run, or meditate. But once a month, the men circle up to talk about, well, their feelings. Downtempo jazz and cartons of maple sap water greeted me as I plunked myself down next to a young man who recently quit his job to become a freelance cinematographer. The evening\u2019s facilitator, Alex Cameron, a man with hulking, tattoo-plastered arms and slicked-back salt-and-pepper hair, told us the theme for this session: emotional literacy. Cameron, who is 40, runs a psychotherapy practice nearby. To start off, Joe, a slight man in a hoodie, volunteered a story about how he came to realize that vulnerability was a strength rather than weakness. \u201cI\u2019ve never shared this in front of a group before,\u201d said Joe, 34, who told us the story of his mother passing away when he was three; how his dad became hardened and distant; and how, at the age of 27, he found himself in deep depression. \u201cI was single, in a job I hated, with very few friends I could count on. I felt like we are all going to die anyways, so what\u2019s the purpose of trying?\u201d Uncovering blocked emotions, Joe told us, saved his life. \u201cI realized if I wasn\u2019t going to take my life, I had to go back in time and work through my feelings. I was a 27-year-old living in a little boy\u2019s trauma. I needed to prove to myself that it was safe to feel again.\u201d We went around the circle sharing whatever came to mind about manhood, emotions, relationships, Donald Trump, Justin Trudeau, Jordan Peterson, the fact that most mass shootings are committed by socially isolated white men. \u201cConversations with other men are usually very superficial,\u201d said Marvin, a transplant from Germany who works at an ad agency. \u201cIt\u2019s always about sex and money,\u201d the man next to him added. (Some of the participants declined to be named for this story.) \u201cLike, \u2018Oh, I got laid last night\u2019. It gets boring.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not only fucking boring, it\u2019s unhealthy,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cMost men suffer alone.\u201d The discussion shifted to the meaning of anger. \u201cI played football growing up and I learned that, as a man, you kept things inside so you could use them as a weapon. But emotions are energy and they have to move, they have to be released,\u201d said Chris, who recently returned from a chakra retreat in Belize. Many men never learn \u201chow to release that energy without using force\u201d. \u201cAnger is like an iceberg,\u201d Alex Cameron, the therapist leading the session, told us. \u201cAnger is what you see, but it comes from everything else below the surface \u2013 shame, fear, guilt. For most men, it feels safer to get angry than express sadness or vulnerability.\u201d He wrapped up on a more personal note. \u201cWhen I feel vulnerable, I cry. It looks like sadness on the outside, but it feels powerful.\u201d Liberation from boys being boys I\u2019ve dropped in on The Huddle several times over the past six months. One meeting focused on mental health and substance abuse; a former drug addict shared the story of his attempted suicide and recent recovery. Another served as a #MeToo confessional. \u201cI bet every man in here has a story about how they\u2019ve mistreated a woman,\u201d the facilitator prodded. After a deafening silence, one man threw up his hands. \u201cI know I\u2019ve done some foul shit.\u201d I met a Reiki healer, a construction worker, a former professional soccer player, a gym owner, a bartender, and several social workers. The group appeared to attract mainly straight, unmarried men in their thirties who share interest in fashion, athletics, and wellness trends; the tattoo quotient of the participants was high. In a nation, and a neighborhood, that is predominantly white, The Huddle crowd skews about 50% black. Lululemon\u2019s dive into the murk of modern masculinity is a hipster-approved strand in a longer lineage of male reckoning. Alongside the din of women\u2019s lib in the late 1960s was the lesser known men\u2019s liberation movement. \u201cMale liberation calls for men to free themselves from the sex role stereotypes that limit their ability to be human,\u201d wrote psychologist Jack Sawyer, an early proponent, in a 1970 issue of Liberation magazine. \u201cThe battle of women to be free need not be a battle against men as oppressors. The choice about whether men are the enemy is up to men themselves.\u201d Today the pro-feminist men\u2019s movement champions causes ranging from reducing violence against women to raising awareness about male suicide and prostate cancer. Adherents dwell in gender studies programs, social justice groups, and mental health organizations\u2014and in small groups of men who gather in coffee shops and living rooms for heartfelt talk. Pro-feminist masculinity has remained relatively obscure, though #MeToo may be changing that. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed male feminists like myself to come out of the shadows,\u201d Michael Kehler, a University of Calgary masculinities studies professor, told me by phone. His career, after two decades of \u201cquiet, diligent work to move this agenda forward,\u201d has flowered with media requests and speaking engagements. In January, Kehler became North America\u2019s first masculinities studies research chair. \u201cUntil recently, there was an allowance, or even an expectation, for men to behave badly, like it was a natural way of being,\u201d Kehler said. \u201c[I]t was written off as \u2018boys being boys\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s just locker room talk\u2019. If you didn\u2019t talk about sports or engage in sexualizing banter, other men might question the adequacy of your masculinity.\u201d Kehler believes this older breed of masculinity is dying. Some evidence, however, suggests otherwise. Pro-feminist men feel that by modulating hypermasculinity, and ceding a wider wedge of societal power to women, they can clear a path to male enlightenment \u2013 something good for men and women. But a countermovement has gained steam. Known as the men\u2019s rights movement, these ad-hoc, mainly internet-based activists are resistant to policies promoting women\u2019s equality and to the men-as-oppressors narrative generally. Oddly enough, the movement\u2019s ideological godfather, Warren Farrell, was a well-known male feminist in the seventies who marched alongside Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. By the time Farrell\u2019s 1993 book The Myth of Male Power arrived on shelves, his metamorphosis was complete: \u201cWhat we, as feminists, did is put men into the oppressor class and called it patriarchy,\u201d he once said of his previous self. While some strands of the men\u2019s rights movement tout their efforts to provide men\u2019s shelters, male-centric mental health services, and legal support in paternity cases, others are openly misogynist. \u201cPussy is the only real empowerment women will ever know,\u201d wrote Paul Elam, the founder of AVoiceForMen.com, to promote the website\u2019s \u201cslap-a-violent-bitch month\u201d in 2017. \u201cPut all the hopelessly wishful thinking of feminist ideology aside and what remains is the fact that it is men and pretty much men only who draw power from accomplishment, who invent technology, build nations, cure disease, create empires and generally advance civilization.\u201d Elam\u2019s online community has been deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. ReturnOfKings.com, a blog for \u201cpickup artists\u201d (men focused on manipulating women into sex), has also earned this distinction. The website\u2019s founder, Daryush Valizadeh, even suggested rape should be legal \u201cif done on private property\u201d. Also in the constellation of men\u2019s rights groups are \u201cincels\u201d \u2013 men who blame women for their inability to attract a mate. (The word is a contraction of \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d.) The online subculture reached notoriety in April when 25-year-old Alek Minassian drove into two dozen pedestrians in Toronto. Eight of the 10 killed were women. \u201cThe Incel Rebellion has already begun,\u201d Minassian posted on Facebook moments before he rammed his rental van into a Yonge Street sidewalk. \u2018Black kids can\u2019t afford therapy - we have to fix ourselves\u2019 Jahmal Padmore, one of the organizers of The Huddle, believes that blaming women, or anyone, does not dissolve one\u2019s woes so much as harden them. The bespectacled, well-muscled 34-year-old gently badgers his male friends to show up for The Huddle because he knows firsthand how difficult it is to reach out for support. \u201cBlack kids can\u2019t afford therapy \u2013 if we\u2019re going to get fixed, we have to do it ourselves,\u201d Padmore, the son of Antiguan immigrants, told me. \u201cSo I just went on YouTube and watched a lot of personal development videos.\u201d Padmore\u2019s craving for self-discovery accelerated as he approached his 30th birthday. He was drinking heavily and had some brushes with mental illness. One day he came across a series of videos by the University of Toronto psychology professor Jordan Peterson, focused on men\u2019s pain. Padmore was hooked \u2013 briefly. \u201cPeterson talked about finding your personal capacity within. I love that, that\u2019s real, that\u2019s what a lot of young men are looking for. When guys are maturing and coming to terms with the fact that they\u2019re not going to be an NBA star, or whatever dreams or expectations they had aren\u2019t being fulfilled, it can be painful. And because we\u2019re men, we\u2019re socialized to not express those feelings of frustration in a healthy way.\u201d In the early 2010s, the eccentric professor was known for TedX talks with innocuous, New Age titles like \u201cPotential\u201d and \u201cRedefining Reality\u201d. But Peterson also had a reputation for blistering attacks on male laziness \u2013 \u201cClean up your room!\u201d he often barks at his young followers \u2013 and criticizing political correctness. In 2016 Peterson\u2019s viral popularity exploded after he protested Bill C-16, legislation adding gender identity to the characteristics protected by Canadian anti-discrimination law. The publication of his book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos in January this year vaulted Peterson into international stardom. While Peterson maintains the persona of a self-help guru styled as a stern but loving father figure \u2013 \u201cTo stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,\u201d he writes \u2013 the threads of intolerance in his work, and the rhetoric of some of his followers, teeter toward hate. In a recent New York Times profile, Peterson surmised that the Toronto van attacker \u201cwas angry at God because women were rejecting him\u201d. He suggested \u201cenforced monogamy\u201d as a societal cure for incels and other disgruntled young men. Peterson has never hidden his view that women should submit to conventional gender roles, but in May he published a chummy 90-minute interview with Warren Farrell, cementing his affinity with the men\u2019s rights movement. Padmore sensed these threads years before they were making headlines. \u201cThe problem I have with Jordan Peterson and his ilk is that, for them, finding your personal [capabilities] comes at the expense of others. I have a huge issue with the tendency to blame women and trans people and anyone that doesn\u2019t conform. Go deep, try to find out more about yourself \u2013 of course \u2013 but don\u2019t drag other people down.\u201d Another reason he quickly fell from the orbit of Peterson\u2019s charisma: \u201cI\u2019m black.\u201d Peterson\u2019s fan base, which is 84 % male according to the data analytics firm Zoomph, is well-steeped in racist alt-right culture. He does not endorse the extreme right-wing movement, but it\u2019s no coincidence that it has largely endorsed him, while the pro-feminist men\u2019s movement has not. But can Lululemon make it cool? Doing pro-feminist men\u2019s work under corporate auspices comes with certain pitfalls. The Huddle is free of charge, but when Padmore shouts \u201cHit me up if you want a discount on some stretchy pants,\u201d one can\u2019t but feel like the target of a sophisticated marketing scheme. The corporation in question also has some skeletons in its closet. \u201cYou know, feminists really hate Lululemon,\u201d my wife said when I mentioned The Huddle. She referred me to an article urging women to \u201cdrop [their] Lululemon obsession\u201d. Lululemon\u2019s founder, Chip Wilson, once suggested that breast cancer rates rose in the nineties because of \u201ccigarette-smoking Power Women who were on the pill\u2026and taking on the stress previously left to men in the working world\u201d. He said that Lululemon clothing was not for plus-sized or even average-sized women. In 2015, after being forced to recall a number of yoga pants with a conspicuous defect \u2013 they became see-through in the crotch after a short period of use \u2013 Wilson resigned. In 2016, a supervisor at a Lululemon in California was accused of raping a female co-worker. The victim\u2019s lawsuit painted the company as a haven for sexual predators \u2013 a place, BuzzFeed wrote, \u201cwhere women are encouraged to wear tight clothes to work, lewd comments go unchecked, and hookups between bosses and subordinates are accepted as par for the course after a wild night of drinking\u201d. This February, Wilson\u2019s replacement as CEO, Laurent Potdevin, was also forced out for misconduct, possibly because of a relationship with a subordinate. (Further details have not yet emerged.) When I contacted Lululemon headquarters to ask how the company reconciled its brand identity as a beacon of yogic enlightenment with its reputation as a bastion of toxic masculinity, a PR rep supplied me with a statement attributed to Ben Stubbington, senior vice president of men\u2019s design: \u201cAt Lululemon we \u2018live in practice\u2019. This is translated literally on the yoga mat and also in all ways we walk in life. [\u2026] As the definitions of masculinity constantly evolve in society, we embrace deconstructing its traditional confines, working to the principle that addressing vulnerability is a strength and has immense power to give back.\u201d Padmore, unwilling to defend the company, took a more prosaic stance. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly concerned with Lululemon\u2019s past, present, or future image; I\u2019m concerned with showing up and doing things that impact people\u2019s lives in a positive way.\u201d He said he hasn\u2019t seen any signs of a culture of toxic masculinity at the company since being hired a year ago. The righteous aren\u2019t immune to hypocrisy, he added. \u201cI think a lot of liberal white folks get caught up in perfection. You\u2019re going to make mistakes, you\u2019re going to fuck up. But I think you have to be okay with that and keep pushing forward.\u201d If the various men\u2019s movement subcultures are in competition for followers, the pro-feminist folks are losing badly. Jordan Peterson has 1.2 million followers on YouTube and more than 700,000 on Twitter. Prominent pro-feminist male personalities count four or five digits at most. Jeff Perera, a figure in Toronto\u2019s pro-feminist men\u2019s community, told me he hasn\u2019t won any converts from the Peterson camp, but has occasionally lost friends who \u201cconverted to the other side\u201d. \u201cWe put out a lot of statistics about the unfortunate realities women go through, which are important for men to hear,\u201d Perera said. \u201cThe problem is a lot of men don\u2019t want to hear some expert telling them what a shitty person they are. They\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, I wasn\u2019t planning on raping anyone today, so peace out\u2019.\u201d Around the time Trump was elected, Perera, 42, worked part-time for Next Gen Men, a non-profit that works with teenage boys to get them thinking outside the gender box. During one afterschool program at an elite prep school outside Toronto, the conversation, Perera recalled, turned to the new US president. \u201cI described him as the \u2018televangelist of toxic masculinity\u2019. I said to the guys, \u2018He\u2019s like Cobra Commander from GI Joe \u2013 he has to have his supervillain logo on everything from his helicopter to his evil headquarters at Trump Tower\u2019. One of the boys looked at me with kind of a deadpan stare, and was like, \u2018That\u2019s actually kind of cool\u2019. It was this moment where I had a crisis of faith. I realized that the movement is failing.\u201d The coolness quotient of the pro-feminist men\u2019s world, at least in the eyes of the average adolescent male, is rather low. Attendees of the annual conference put on by the National Organization of Men Against Sexism are likely to be treated to rousing renditions of songs like \u201cLet the Woman In You Come Through\u201d or \u201cWomb Envy\u201d. One can imagine howls of laughter from 16-year-olds forced to sing along to \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Wee-Wee, So What\u2019s the Big Deal?\u201d Which is why it may not be a bad thing for a trendy, globally recognized brand, however imperfect, to take up the torch. Jian Pablico, who originated The Huddle at Lululemon\u2019s Vancouver headquarters, told me his role as a \u201cmindful performance manager\u201d is to \u201ccurate\u201d non-traditional masculinity for \u201cmen who may not be part of that culture yet\u201d. That\u2019s why the touchy-feely talks are held only one day a month. \u201cWe wanted to find a way to bring people together who might be hesitant about showing up for a conversation on vulnerability,\u201d Pablico said. \u201cSweating together first helps it come naturally. Once you suffer together in a workout, you begin to bond and a layer of the mask comes off. It\u2019s then a little easier to chat afterwards over a beer. Or a kombucha.\u201d *** Jordan Peterson views feminism as an emasculating force. He believes men ought to be allowed to be unapologetically tough, ambitious, competitive, and forceful. But no one in the pro-feminist camp has really suggested that men can\u2019t be tough, ambitious, competitive, or forceful \u2013 only that it is unhealthy to suppress other ways of being. After his Huddle session on emotional literacy, Alex Cameron, the therapist, showed me his tattoos. I\u2019d assumed they were a relic from some previous life as a bouncer or lumberjack. It turns out he got them on graduating his master\u2019s in social work. One arm depicts a dragon, symbol of virility; the other, a phoenix, which in Chinese mythology signifies feminine grace.\u201cWe have opposing sides within us,\u201d Cameron said. Harmony, he believes, must come from \u201cembracing our entire self\u201d.",

          "body": "<p>Serious times call for serious listening. That\u2019s one explanation, at least, for the current explosion in political podcasting. Brexit, the rise of the spectacularly unpredictable Donald Trump, the spread of far-right and far-left populism \u2013 all feed a hunger to understand what\u2019s going on and a feeling that it isn\u2019t safe to fall too far behind the news. Something similar happened in the immediate aftermath of the credit crunch, when the realisation that something life-changing had evidently been going on beneath our noses prompted a thirst for anything \u2013 books, public lectures, documentaries \u2013 that helped readers get to grips with a bewildering world of sub-prime lending and quantitative easing. Now it\u2019s knowing your hard border from your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/brexit-what-is-the-uks-backstop-proposal\" title=\"\">hard backstop</a>, or pondering whether the porn star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/stormy-daniels\" title=\"\">Stormy Daniels</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/17/mueller-trump-russia-investigation-drowned-out-news\" title=\"\">Mueller investigation</a> into Russian electoral interference has the greater chance of bringing Trump down.</p> <p>But the particular genius of podcasts is that they give the listener back a sense of control over a news cycle that is beginning to feel overwhelming. We are bombarded around the clock with information, from print, TV, radio and social media; drowning in ideas and arguments and opinions, struggling to separate the signal from the noise. Dwindling audiences for flagship political programming such as Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, meanwhile, suggest many listeners are discovering there\u2019s only so many doom-laden stories they can take before breakfast.</p> <p>But the best podcasts distil everything you want to know into one manageable weekly catchup, to be downloaded and listened to whenever you want: out for a run, in the car, while doing the ironing. And like radio, good podcasts make good company. They burble along in the background much of the time, but every now and then your ears prick up at something.</p> <p>Admittedly, the political versions are unlikely to topple <em>Love Island: The Morning After</em> from the top of the iTunes chart \u2013 although episodes of the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s <em>Politics Weekly</em> podcast and the BBC\u2019s <em>Political Thinking With Nick Robinson</em> both made the top 100 in last week\u2019s rankings \u2013 but the potential audience is growing all the time. A <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/04/02/76-uk-listeners-have-acted-podcast-ad-according-acast\" title=\"\">quarter of Britons</a> have listened to a podcast in the past month, according to a recent report from podcasting specialists Acast, and on average these listeners spend more than three and a half hours a week on podcasts. Since they are cheap to make, they are also \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 a promising vehicle for political views that don\u2019t always find&#xa0;their&#xa0;way easily into conventional media.</p> <p>That has been a gift to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s impatient outriders, chafing at what they see as the mainstream media\u2019s continued scepticism about the Labour leader and reluctance to grant the radical left a platform. Shows like the slick <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/reelpolitikpodcast\" title=\"\"><em>Reel Politik</em></a>, featuring a revolving cast of young Corbynistas being endlessly rude about the other half of the Labour party, or <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/this-is-distorted/political-ramblings-with-owen-jones-and-ellie-ohagan\" title=\"\"><em>Agitpod</em></a> \u2013 hosted by <em>Guardian</em> writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-jones\" title=\"\">Owen Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ellie-mae-o-hagan\" title=\"\">Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a> \u2013 fill what they see as a yawning gap in conventional coverage and focus more closely on grassroots leftwing activism and ideas.</p> <p>But the format allows even conventional journalists to escape the confines of a normal news bulletin, whether that means diving deeper into the technical detail (as on the BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05299nl\" title=\"\"><em>Brexitcast</em></a>, with the engagingly nerdy Chris Mason and Adam Fleming) or bringing some irreverence to the party. <a href=\"https://choppersbrexitpodcast.telegraph.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Chopper\u2019s Brexit Podcast</em></a>, chaired by the <em>Telegraph</em>\u2019s Christopher Hope, is a very different beast from the pro-European <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast\" title=\"\"><em>Remainiacs</em> podcast</a> \u2013 one is a hotbed of Leaver gossip, while the other lives up to its mission to \u201cown the Remoan\u201d \u2013 but both are relaxed, cheeky and occasionally mischievous.</p> <p>Podcasting has its weaknesses, chiefly a tendency to self-indulgence. The downside of having more time for exploring ideas is that contributors who adore the sound of their own voices can ramble on for way too long. There are also surprisingly few women hosts \u2013 if anything, podcasting can be even more pale, male and stale than conventional political journalism \u2013 and now that every media outlet feels compelled to produce their own, it\u2019s getting harder to pick out the gems.</p> <p>So here is the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s guide to 10 of the best, from the elegantly intellectual to the distinctly raucous. Getting plugged into politics has never been easier.</p> <h2>Ed Miliband: \u2018You can do serious and lighthearted\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f63608a5c579b603513e941b985754dc2277a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f63608a5c579b603513e941b985754dc2277a18/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Miliband at his home in Dartmouth Park, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Miliband at his home in Dartmouth Park, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://cheerful.libsyn.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Reasons to Be Cheerful</strong></a><br><strong>Ed Miliband is Labour MP for </strong><strong>Doncaster North</strong><strong> and the former leader of the Labour party. He co-hosts the <em>Reasons to Be Cheerful</em> podcast with broadcaster </strong><strong>Geoff Lloyd</strong><strong>, who he met when the latter interviewed him during the election. They record it in Geoff\u2019s loft, attracting about 70,000 listeners a week. </strong></p> <p><strong>How did the podcast start?</strong><br>Geoff came to me and said: \u201cI think people are incredibly depressed because of Brexit, Trump, all that, but there must be some more good ideas out there. Why don\u2019t we do something that says there\u2019s a positive, optimistic way to change the country?\u201d I\u2019d been wanting since the election to find a way to promote and think about big ideas. Maybe in the old days I\u2019d have started a thinktank or something, but this gives us a way of showing the ideas to a larger audience.</p> <p>The other thing that happened between Geoff suggesting it and it happening was that I did the Jeremy Vine show [standing in temporarily for Vine as host on Radio 2]. That convinced me that you can do serious and lighthearted and that\u2019s what we try to do.</p> <p><strong>Does it allow you to be more yourself than frontline politics did?</strong><br>There are inevitable constraints being leader of the opposition, which you don\u2019t get being a backbench MP. But having said that, I was probably too constrained, and you learn. Lots of people say on Twitter: \u201cOoh, where was this Ed in 2015?\u201d, which obviously drives me bananas. But it partly has some truth in it and partly it\u2019s those&#xa0;constraints.</p> <p><strong>Favourite episode?</strong><br>The first was on universal basic income and there\u2019s something about the bigness of that idea\u2026 the bigger and more transformative they are, they\u2019re the ones I\u2019ve liked the best.</p> <p><strong>Who should listen?</strong><br>People who want to be cheerful. What I\u2019ve learned is if you think of any problem, there will be a solution happening in some part of Britain or another country. Take homelessness: there\u2019s this thing in Finland called <a href=\"http://housingfirsteurope.eu/countries/finland/\" title=\"\">Housing First</a>, that\u2019s made a massive difference so we talked to a guy from Finland about how they eliminated homelessness. We did a woman from Boston about their <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/massachusetts-equal-pay-law\" title=\"\">gender pay law</a>. So, people who think there are problems and they can be solved, people across the political spectrum \u2013 we do get emails saying: \u201cI\u2019m a Tory, I\u2019d never have voted for you, but I like some of the ideas.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What other podcasts do you like?</strong><br><a href=\"https://art19.com/shows/pod-save-america\" title=\"\"><em>Pod Save America</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05299nl\" title=\"\"><em>Brexitcast</em></a>, David Runciman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Talking Politics</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04x5pd7/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\"><em>Fortunately</em></a><em>\u2026</em>, the Jane Garvey/Fi Glover one.

We never got shouty or ranty but there were very spirited discussions and that was the genesis. We started off presenting together, but Tim\u2019s very busy and he just actually said: \u201cYou know what, you\u2019re better at this\u201d, which powerful men don\u2019t tend to do very often.</p> <p><strong>Why listen?</strong><br>It\u2019s a really broad range of people and subjects. In a lot of political panel discussions, you hear the same topics being regurgitated, but we ask our guests to pick stories they think are important but under-reported. There\u2019s quite a strong international slant; we do a lot on tech, data, things like artificial intelligence too.</p> <p><strong>Favourite episode?</strong><br>When you get two people who\u2019ve had a serious spat on social media come together on the programme and they end up seeing each other in a different light. We did a really good one with ex-Blair aide] John McTernan and [ex-Corbyn aide] Matt Zarb-Cousin. They\u2019d been having a big ding-dong on Twitter but then had a really thoughtful, interesting <a href=\"https://unherd.com/the-feed-blog/weekly-podcast-save-high-street/\" title=\"\">discussion about the death of the high street</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do political podcasts resonate outside the bubble?</strong><br>I think there\u2019s a small market of listeners, but they\u2019re quite committed. If you like political podcasts, you won\u2019t just listen to one, you\u2019ve got a thirst for it.</p> <p><strong>Dream guest?</strong><br>Barack Obama obviously! But a thoughtful person from the Corbyn project would be good \u2013 I\u2019d love to have [Momentum founder] Jon Lansman because I do think the Corbyn project, whether you agree with it or not, has changed politics.</p> <p><strong>What will happen with Brexit?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s going to be the stickiest, messiest Brexit.

It was a way to make politics more exciting, but it\u2019s gone too far the other way now \u2013 I\u2019d like it to calm down a bit. There\u2019s a distinction between big personalities and people that are wilfully destructive.</p> <p><strong>How do you feel about the way politics has changed since you started?</strong><br>I\u2019ve become a lot more cynical. It\u2019s a shame that some of the politicians who\u2019ve risen to the top are not the best reflection, not just of the political class, but of British society. We\u2019re uniquely ill-served at a time when we need our very best. Our leaders have been reckless and feckless and cavalier, but the majority of members of parliament are still very good.

She was moved by being allowed to represent the public.

I get emails from people who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily listen to political stuff, maybe because I\u2019ve always done a lot of football and sporting things. It\u2019s conversational and light and an easy way in, not deep analysis.</p> <p><strong>Who would be your dream guest?</strong><br>Oh, Donald Trump. He\u2019d be weird. Evasive. Probably good fun, sadly. And Hillary Clinton \u2013 I think she\u2019s been treated disgracefully.</p> <p><strong>Do you also listen to radio?</strong><br>The <em>Today</em> programme every morning, although I\u2019m not a big fan of John Humphrys.</p> <p><strong>What do you predict is going to happen with Brexit?</strong><br>Oh crikey. A complete fudge. A total mess.</p> <p><strong>Who will be prime minister in a year\u2019s time?</strong><br>Theresa May.

Guests, who are exclusively from the Remain camp, have included Gina Miller, Al Murray, Nick Clegg and Jay Rayner. It attracts 30-40,000 listeners a week.</strong></p> <p><strong>When and why did the podcast begin?</strong><br>Just over a year ago ahead of the general election. We felt there was nowhere that was unashamedly anti-Brexit in the media: the press was largely pro-Brexit and broadcasters are bound by balance rules. So <em>Remainiacs</em> is a safe, fun space for people who believe we should stay in the EU.</p> <p><strong>How did you feel when the Brexit vote was announced?</strong><br>Devastated but not surprised. I\u2019d actually left a permanent, well-paid job to join one of the official Remain campaigns, because I was so worried. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to undo 40 years of the Murdoch press pouring bile on the EU in a few short weeks of campaigning. The podcast was a way to channel the frustration we had into something positive.</p> <p><strong>What do you love about the podcast format?</strong><br>You can get a depth of analysis from experts you\u2019d ordinarily only get in a well-researched written piece. If you\u2019re commuting, often you can\u2019t read but you can listen to something. I also love that we always try to end on a high note, with something a bit silly, like deciding which TV detective would have voted Leave or Remain.</p> <p><strong>Best episode?</strong><br><a href=\"https://audioboom.com/posts/6367228-tory-co-ference-special\" title=\"\">Comedian Ahir Shah was absolutely fantastic</a>: he was able to really call Brexit out for what it is in terms of the pain it\u2019s going to cause future generations.</p> <p><strong>Who are your competitors?</strong><br><em>Reasons to be Cheerful</em>, Ed Miliband\u2019s podcast, is fantastic \u2013 it offers a really interesting critique on lots of the issues of the day.</p> <p><strong>Do you think you resonate beyond a certain bubble?</strong><br>I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re trying to \u2013 we\u2019re aiming to reach people who voted Remain.

Runciman is joined by a regular panel of fellow Cambridge academics and one-off guests such as </strong><strong>MP Jess Phillips </strong><strong>and economist </strong><strong>Thomas Piketty</strong><strong>. The podcast has had more than 2.7m downloads to date.</strong></p> <p><strong>Why did you start your podcast?</strong><br>Partly because politics had got super-interesting and I live in a town where people are having conversations about politics all the time. And partly because I\u2019ve spent my life listening to radio and always wanted to do more of it, and a format opened up where you could do it yourself. We got a partnership with the LRB to support it, but we don\u2019t come out of the magazine, nor do we come out of a university. We\u2019re somewhere between the two.</p> <p><strong>Sum up <em>Talking Politics</em> in one sentence.</strong><br>It\u2019s conversations about politics by people who are really interested in it and taken aback by what\u2019s happened in the past couple of years \u2013 we\u2019re capturing that sense of \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Does it resonate beyond a certain bubble?</strong><br>Our audience includes quite a lot of people at universities, at schools, people who work in government, but we\u2019ve got quite a young audience too. A lot of sixth formers listen to us, and other people quite fresh to politics.</p> <p><strong>What are your favourite episodes?</strong><br>We did one with the <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/talkingpolitics/judithbutler\" title=\"\">American feminist writer Judith Butler</a> just after Trump won, and one with the <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/talkingpolitics/jilllepore\" title=\"\">American historian Jill Lepore</a> just before the inauguration \u2013 both really well informed and both reeling in different ways. You always discover things about people when they\u2019re reeling.</p> <p><strong>Who is your dream guest?</strong><br>JK Rowling, because she\u2019s very political. She\u2019s one of the most interesting people on Twitter. She\u2019s really engaged about Scottish independence and Brexit, she\u2019s very forceful and brave \u2013 and she\u2019s JK Rowling. For quite a few years now I\u2019ve been teaching the Harry Potter generation and for a lot of them, I think, their first experience of thinking about politics and good and evil was thinking about Voldemort. I can think of students who\u2019ve written really interesting accounts of politics using Harry Potter as a frame, so I have a very clear answer to that question. The problem is access.</p> <p><strong>Who are your competitors?</strong><br>One recent sub-genre is the podcast hosted by a politician or ex-politician \u2013 so the Ed Miliband one or the Nick Clegg one \u2013 and we\u2019re in a similar space to the magazine podcasts, such as those by the New Statesman and the Economist. But I like to think we\u2019re a bit different to both. I hope people get a sense from the range of panellists that we are never coming at an issue from one point of view \u2013 we\u2019re not the anti-Trump podcast or the this-or-that-way-on-Brexit podcast. Also, we talk a lot more about international politics than other British podcasts.</p> <p><strong>How long in advance do you decide what to cover?</strong><br>We think about it over the weekend, my producer and I suggest things we\u2019d like to talk about, but it\u2019s fairly freeform. We never try to decide where it\u2019s going to end up. We record on Wednesday mornings, it goes out Wednesday night, and people pick it up first thing Thursday.</p> <p><strong>What other podcasts do you really like?</strong><br>My tastes are pretty conventional. I really like the Malcolm Gladwell one [Revisionist History]. I like This American Life and its offshoots. I tend not to listen to a huge amount of the politics ones, not out of rivalry but because your head can get cluttered. I spend my life studying politics, writing about it, teaching it, then talking about it. I like the ones that are slightly at one remove, but are still sort of political.</p> <p><strong>What do you predict is going to happen with Brexit?</strong><br>It will happen. I don\u2019t think there will be a second referendum. My feeling is that at some point someone in British politics is going to own it \u2013 probably the current government, but possibly the next one \u2013 and then I think a whole new set of battle lines will emerge.

Episodes, which come out at the rate of about three a month, are free-flowing takes on the latest news stories from both sides of the Atlantic.

Why does Britain have a housing crisis? Why do so many people hate big capital cities? Are there really alligators in the New York sewers? The focus roves far and wide, as host Jonn Elledge and his guests consider the rapid urbanisation of China and look back at city life in Victorian London and ancient Rome. It\u2019s done with a light touch, but over nearly 100 episodes it gets to the heart of what makes a city work (or fail to do so). <strong>Killian Fox</strong></p>",

          "bodyText": "Serious times call for serious listening. That\u2019s one explanation, at least, for the current explosion in political podcasting. Brexit, the rise of the spectacularly unpredictable Donald Trump, the spread of far-right and far-left populism \u2013 all feed a hunger to understand what\u2019s going on and a feeling that it isn\u2019t safe to fall too far behind the news. Something similar happened in the immediate aftermath of the credit crunch, when the realisation that something life-changing had evidently been going on beneath our noses prompted a thirst for anything \u2013 books, public lectures, documentaries \u2013 that helped readers get to grips with a bewildering world of sub-prime lending and quantitative easing. Now it\u2019s knowing your hard border from your hard backstop, or pondering whether the porn star Stormy Daniels or the Mueller investigation into Russian electoral interference has the greater chance of bringing Trump down. But the particular genius of podcasts is that they give the listener back a sense of control over a news cycle that is beginning to feel overwhelming. We are bombarded around the clock with information, from print, TV, radio and social media; drowning in ideas and arguments and opinions, struggling to separate the signal from the noise. Dwindling audiences for flagship political programming such as Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, meanwhile, suggest many listeners are discovering there\u2019s only so many doom-laden stories they can take before breakfast. But the best podcasts distil everything you want to know into one manageable weekly catchup, to be downloaded and listened to whenever you want: out for a run, in the car, while doing the ironing. And like radio, good podcasts make good company. They burble along in the background much of the time, but every now and then your ears prick up at something. Admittedly, the political versions are unlikely to topple Love Island: The Morning After from the top of the iTunes chart \u2013 although episodes of the Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast and the BBC\u2019s Political Thinking With Nick Robinson both made the top 100 in last week\u2019s rankings \u2013 but the potential audience is growing all the time. A quarter of Britons have listened to a podcast in the past month, according to a recent report from podcasting specialists Acast, and on average these listeners spend more than three and a half hours a week on podcasts. Since they are cheap to make, they are also \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 a promising vehicle for political views that don\u2019t always find their way easily into conventional media. That has been a gift to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s impatient outriders, chafing at what they see as the mainstream media\u2019s continued scepticism about the Labour leader and reluctance to grant the radical left a platform. Shows like the slick Reel Politik, featuring a revolving cast of young Corbynistas being endlessly rude about the other half of the Labour party, or Agitpod \u2013 hosted by Guardian writer Owen Jones and Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan \u2013 fill what they see as a yawning gap in conventional coverage and focus more closely on grassroots leftwing activism and ideas. But the format allows even conventional journalists to escape the confines of a normal news bulletin, whether that means diving deeper into the technical detail (as on the BBC\u2019s Brexitcast, with the engagingly nerdy Chris Mason and Adam Fleming) or bringing some irreverence to the party. Chopper\u2019s Brexit Podcast, chaired by the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope, is a very different beast from the pro-European Remainiacs podcast \u2013 one is a hotbed of Leaver gossip, while the other lives up to its mission to \u201cown the Remoan\u201d \u2013 but both are relaxed, cheeky and occasionally mischievous. Podcasting has its weaknesses, chiefly a tendency to self-indulgence. The downside of having more time for exploring ideas is that contributors who adore the sound of their own voices can ramble on for way too long. There are also surprisingly few women hosts \u2013 if anything, podcasting can be even more pale, male and stale than conventional political journalism \u2013 and now that every media outlet feels compelled to produce their own, it\u2019s getting harder to pick out the gems. So here is the Observer\u2019s guide to 10 of the best, from the elegantly intellectual to the distinctly raucous. Getting plugged into politics has never been easier. Ed Miliband: \u2018You can do serious and lighthearted\u2019 Reasons to Be Cheerful Ed Miliband is Labour MP for Doncaster North and the former leader of the Labour party. He co-hosts the Reasons to Be Cheerful podcast with broadcaster Geoff Lloyd, who he met when the latter interviewed him during the election. They record it in Geoff\u2019s loft, attracting about 70,000 listeners a week. How did the podcast start? Geoff came to me and said: \u201cI think people are incredibly depressed because of Brexit, Trump, all that, but there must be some more good ideas out there. Why don\u2019t we do something that says there\u2019s a positive, optimistic way to change the country?\u201d I\u2019d been wanting since the election to find a way to promote and think about big ideas. Maybe in the old days I\u2019d have started a thinktank or something, but this gives us a way of showing the ideas to a larger audience. The other thing that happened between Geoff suggesting it and it happening was that I did the Jeremy Vine show [standing in temporarily for Vine as host on Radio 2]. That convinced me that you can do serious and lighthearted and that\u2019s what we try to do. Does it allow you to be more yourself than frontline politics did? There are inevitable constraints being leader of the opposition, which you don\u2019t get being a backbench MP. But having said that, I was probably too constrained, and you learn. Lots of people say on Twitter: \u201cOoh, where was this Ed in 2015?\u201d, which obviously drives me bananas. But it partly has some truth in it and partly it\u2019s those constraints. Favourite episode? The first was on universal basic income and there\u2019s something about the bigness of that idea\u2026 the bigger and more transformative they are, they\u2019re the ones I\u2019ve liked the best. Who should listen? People who want to be cheerful. What I\u2019ve learned is if you think of any problem, there will be a solution happening in some part of Britain or another country. Take homelessness: there\u2019s this thing in Finland called Housing First, that\u2019s made a massive difference so we talked to a guy from Finland about how they eliminated homelessness. We did a woman from Boston about their gender pay law. So, people who think there are problems and they can be solved, people across the political spectrum \u2013 we do get emails saying: \u201cI\u2019m a Tory, I\u2019d never have voted for you, but I like some of the ideas.\u201d What other podcasts do you like? Pod Save America, Brexitcast, David Runciman\u2019s Talking Politics and Fortunately\u2026, the Jane Garvey/Fi Glover one. And Slow Burn, an eight-part thing about Watergate \u2013 you might think you know everything about Watergate, but it\u2019s absolutely brilliant. Do you still listen to radio? \u201cI do listen to conventional radio, but in a way [podcasting] does provide an alternative. I\u2019ll sometimes, in the morning, not listen to the Today programme, and listen instead to a podcast. Who will be prime minister in a year\u2019s time? Pass on that. I gave up the predictions business in 2015. Interview by Gaby Hinsliff Ayesha Hazarika: \u2018If you like political podcasts, you won\u2019t just listen to one, you\u2019ve got a thirst for it\u2019 UnHerd Ayesha Hazarika hosts this podcast for the website UnHerd.com. She\u2019s a former special adviser for the Labour party, a standup comedian and author of Punch and Judy Politics: An Insider\u2019s Guide to Prime Minster\u2019s Questions. How did the podcast start? I used to do newspaper reviews with [UnHerd founder] Tim Montgomerie on the BBC and though we come from very different backgrounds \u2013 he\u2019s a very traditional Conservative, I\u2019m obviously Labour \u2013 we do get on. We never got shouty or ranty but there were very spirited discussions and that was the genesis. We started off presenting together, but Tim\u2019s very busy and he just actually said: \u201cYou know what, you\u2019re better at this\u201d, which powerful men don\u2019t tend to do very often. Why listen? It\u2019s a really broad range of people and subjects. In a lot of political panel discussions, you hear the same topics being regurgitated, but we ask our guests to pick stories they think are important but under-reported. There\u2019s quite a strong international slant; we do a lot on tech, data, things like artificial intelligence too. Favourite episode? When you get two people who\u2019ve had a serious spat on social media come together on the programme and they end up seeing each other in a different light. We did a really good one with ex-Blair aide] John McTernan and [ex-Corbyn aide] Matt Zarb-Cousin. They\u2019d been having a big ding-dong on Twitter but then had a really thoughtful, interesting discussion about the death of the high street. Do political podcasts resonate outside the bubble? I think there\u2019s a small market of listeners, but they\u2019re quite committed. If you like political podcasts, you won\u2019t just listen to one, you\u2019ve got a thirst for it. Dream guest? Barack Obama obviously! But a thoughtful person from the Corbyn project would be good \u2013 I\u2019d love to have [Momentum founder] Jon Lansman because I do think the Corbyn project, whether you agree with it or not, has changed politics. What will happen with Brexit? I think it\u2019s going to be the stickiest, messiest Brexit. We\u2019re going to leave [the EU], but it\u2019s going to be completely unsatisfactory to everybody and it\u2019s not going to resolve any of the underlying issues. Who\u2019ll be prime minister in a year? Once the Brexit deal is done I think Theresa May will be pushed out. Interview by Gaby Hinsliff Matt Forde: \u2018I wanted an antidote to combative interviews\u2019 The Political Party Matt Forde\u2019s monthly live show The Political Party has regularly sold out Westminster\u2019s The Other Palace for nearly six years. Each show starts with standup from Forde, followed by an interview with a leading politician. Previous guests have included Tony Blair, Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Ruth Davidson. Now a weekly release, the podcast has had more than 1 million downloads on Soundcloud. Forde hosts two special episodes at the Edinburgh festival fringe on 9 and 15 August before returning to London for the show\u2019s monthly residency. How did the podcast start? I wanted to create a comedy night that showcased politicians in an informal, cheeky environment, as an antidote to combative style interviews. It was a way to make politics more exciting, but it\u2019s gone too far the other way now \u2013 I\u2019d like it to calm down a bit. There\u2019s a distinction between big personalities and people that are wilfully destructive. How do you feel about the way politics has changed since you started? I\u2019ve become a lot more cynical. It\u2019s a shame that some of the politicians who\u2019ve risen to the top are not the best reflection, not just of the political class, but of British society. We\u2019re uniquely ill-served at a time when we need our very best. Our leaders have been reckless and feckless and cavalier, but the majority of members of parliament are still very good. That\u2019s some hope to cling on to. Best episode so far? The Tessa Jowell one was very special: the effect on the audience in the room was quite profound. She was moved by being allowed to represent the public. It\u2019s a good demonstration of why she was so loved, not just respected. What other podcasts do you like? Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, The Westminster Hour with Carolyn Quinn. And Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson\u2019s Athletico Mince is one of the funniest things I\u2019ve ever heard. Do you think your podcast resonates beyond a certain bubble? I do. I get emails from people who wouldn\u2019t ordinarily listen to political stuff, maybe because I\u2019ve always done a lot of football and sporting things. It\u2019s conversational and light and an easy way in, not deep analysis. Who would be your dream guest? Oh, Donald Trump. He\u2019d be weird. Evasive. Probably good fun, sadly. And Hillary Clinton \u2013 I think she\u2019s been treated disgracefully. Do you also listen to radio? The Today programme every morning, although I\u2019m not a big fan of John Humphrys. What do you predict is going to happen with Brexit? Oh crikey. A complete fudge. A total mess. Who will be prime minister in a year\u2019s time? Theresa May. I just think there\u2019s plenty of Brexit negotiations left for a successor to not fancy it yet. That said, a lot of my predictions lately have been completely wrong, so... Interview by Kathryn Bromwich Naomi Smith: \u2018You can get a depth of analysis from experts\u2019 Remainiacs: The Brexit Podcast Remainiacs (tag line: Ho-hey, let\u2019s stay) is a weekly podcast covering the latest Brexit negotiations, with analysis and lighthearted commentary from presenters Dorian Lynskey, Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith and Ros Taylor. Guests, who are exclusively from the Remain camp, have included Gina Miller, Al Murray, Nick Clegg and Jay Rayner. It attracts 30-40,000 listeners a week. When and why did the podcast begin? Just over a year ago ahead of the general election. We felt there was nowhere that was unashamedly anti-Brexit in the media: the press was largely pro-Brexit and broadcasters are bound by balance rules. So Remainiacs is a safe, fun space for people who believe we should stay in the EU. How did you feel when the Brexit vote was announced? Devastated but not surprised. I\u2019d actually left a permanent, well-paid job to join one of the official Remain campaigns, because I was so worried. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to undo 40 years of the Murdoch press pouring bile on the EU in a few short weeks of campaigning. The podcast was a way to channel the frustration we had into something positive. What do you love about the podcast format? You can get a depth of analysis from experts you\u2019d ordinarily only get in a well-researched written piece. If you\u2019re commuting, often you can\u2019t read but you can listen to something. I also love that we always try to end on a high note, with something a bit silly, like deciding which TV detective would have voted Leave or Remain. Best episode? Comedian Ahir Shah was absolutely fantastic: he was able to really call Brexit out for what it is in terms of the pain it\u2019s going to cause future generations. Who are your competitors? Reasons to be Cheerful, Ed Miliband\u2019s podcast, is fantastic \u2013 it offers a really interesting critique on lots of the issues of the day. Do you think you resonate beyond a certain bubble? I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re trying to \u2013 we\u2019re aiming to reach people who voted Remain. So, if we\u2019re honest, no. It\u2019s to give Remainers confidence that Brexit isn\u2019t over yet \u2013 there is all to play for still. Dream guest? Justin Trudeau. He\u2019s a great prime minister who has shown a dedication to making Canada a friendly environment for people of different backgrounds, cultures and faiths to go and work. What\u2019s going to happen with Brexit? We\u2019ll stop it! Who will be PM in a year\u2019s time? I\u2019ll take a punt and say Clive Lewis. Interview by Kathryn Bromwich David Runciman: \u2018We\u2019re capturing that sense of: \u2018what the hell is going on?\u2019 Talking Politics Launched after the Brexit vote in 2016 by Cambridge University professor David Runciman, Talking Politics is a weekly podcast that covers international and domestic affairs. Runciman is joined by a regular panel of fellow Cambridge academics and one-off guests such as MP Jess Phillips and economist Thomas Piketty. The podcast has had more than 2.7m downloads to date. Why did you start your podcast? Partly because politics had got super-interesting and I live in a town where people are having conversations about politics all the time. And partly because I\u2019ve spent my life listening to radio and always wanted to do more of it, and a format opened up where you could do it yourself. We got a partnership with the LRB to support it, but we don\u2019t come out of the magazine, nor do we come out of a university. We\u2019re somewhere between the two. Sum up Talking Politics in one sentence. It\u2019s conversations about politics by people who are really interested in it and taken aback by what\u2019s happened in the past couple of years \u2013 we\u2019re capturing that sense of \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Does it resonate beyond a certain bubble? Our audience includes quite a lot of people at universities, at schools, people who work in government, but we\u2019ve got quite a young audience too. A lot of sixth formers listen to us, and other people quite fresh to politics. What are your favourite episodes? We did one with the American feminist writer Judith Butler just after Trump won, and one with the American historian Jill Lepore just before the inauguration \u2013 both really well informed and both reeling in different ways. You always discover things about people when they\u2019re reeling. Who is your dream guest? JK Rowling, because she\u2019s very political. She\u2019s one of the most interesting people on Twitter. She\u2019s really engaged about Scottish independence and Brexit, she\u2019s very forceful and brave \u2013 and she\u2019s JK Rowling. For quite a few years now I\u2019ve been teaching the Harry Potter generation and for a lot of them, I think, their first experience of thinking about politics and good and evil was thinking about Voldemort. I can think of students who\u2019ve written really interesting accounts of politics using Harry Potter as a frame, so I have a very clear answer to that question. The problem is access. Who are your competitors? One recent sub-genre is the podcast hosted by a politician or ex-politician \u2013 so the Ed Miliband one or the Nick Clegg one \u2013 and we\u2019re in a similar space to the magazine podcasts, such as those by the New Statesman and the Economist. But I like to think we\u2019re a bit different to both. I hope people get a sense from the range of panellists that we are never coming at an issue from one point of view \u2013 we\u2019re not the anti-Trump podcast or the this-or-that-way-on-Brexit podcast. Also, we talk a lot more about international politics than other British podcasts. How long in advance do you decide what to cover? We think about it over the weekend, my producer and I suggest things we\u2019d like to talk about, but it\u2019s fairly freeform. We never try to decide where it\u2019s going to end up. We record on Wednesday mornings, it goes out Wednesday night, and people pick it up first thing Thursday. What other podcasts do you really like? My tastes are pretty conventional. I really like the Malcolm Gladwell one [Revisionist History]. I like This American Life and its offshoots. I tend not to listen to a huge amount of the politics ones, not out of rivalry but because your head can get cluttered. I spend my life studying politics, writing about it, teaching it, then talking about it. I like the ones that are slightly at one remove, but are still sort of political. What do you predict is going to happen with Brexit? It will happen. I don\u2019t think there will be a second referendum. My feeling is that at some point someone in British politics is going to own it \u2013 probably the current government, but possibly the next one \u2013 and then I think a whole new set of battle lines will emerge. British politics will really start to turn on the opposition to that deal. But at the moment I think we\u2019re still in the pre-phase where neither party can pull the dividing lines together. Who will be prime minister in a year\u2019s time? That\u2019s a hard question, a year is a hell of a long time in politics, but Theresa May is amazingly resilient. Given there have been at least four moments when we were doing the podcast that I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d last beyond the week, I\u2019m going to say Theresa May will be PM in a year\u2019s time \u2013 with a big hedge. Interview by Killian Fox Five more political podcasts to try Political Thinking with Nick Robinson Since April 2017, Nick Robinson has been supplementing his Today programme output with a weekly BBC podcast surveying the madhouse that is pre-Brexit British politics. The first batch of episodes of addressed a specific theme, such as \u201cIs the NHS sustainable?\u201d, but since September Robinson has devoted most of his 25-minute-plus running time to grilling a single guest, from politicians to political observers such as James Graham and Armando Iannucci.The longer, more relaxed format plays to his interviewing strengths and he gets a lot out of his subjects, even persuading David Lammy to sing a few lines of his favourite choral piece. The Jess Phillips one is a good place to start, and, if you want an indication of which episode Robinson most enjoyed recording, it\u2019s worth noting that he afforded a full 40 minutes to Jacob Rees-Mogg. Unfiltered with James O\u2019Brien Perhaps as a respite from his LBC talk show, where he is famous for his beleaguered, stream-of-consciousness rants about our national shortcomings and the many absurdities of Brexit, James O\u2019Brien also presents this excellent podcast for Joe.co.uk, where he lets other people talk at considerable length (usually an hour) with just a few well-timed nudges to keep them on track. You\u2019ll notice that the guests are mostly people O\u2019Brien is predisposed to like: Ronan Farrow, the rapper and activist Akala and \u2013 veering away from the purely political \u2013 Star Wars actor Mark Hamill. His riveting interview with Bill Browder, aka Vladimir Putin\u2019s public enemy number one, is worth the price of admission alone (though the podcast is free). Anxious and Insecure \u201cWarning: this podcast contains strong language, politics, bad jokes and the opinions of young people,\u201d is how Anxious and Insecure introduces itself at the beginning of each episode, giving fair warning to anyone with a low tolerance for millennial humour. Its hosts Oli Foster (a Londoner) and Arthur Garcia III (from Texas) gamely play up to type \u2013 they describe themselves as \u201cthe two most millennial millennials ever\u201d, but beneath the joking around there\u2019s some keen political analysis at work. Episodes, which come out at the rate of about three a month, are free-flowing takes on the latest news stories from both sides of the Atlantic. Recently, they\u2019ve tackled Windrush, gun violence and the ill-advised outbursts of Kanye West. Partly Political Broadcast London-born standup Tiernan Douieb recently crossed the 100-episode mark with his two-and-a-half-year-old podcast which, he says, \u201ccombines politics and comedy together to form politimedy, which isn\u2019t really a thing, but I reckon if we all say it often enough, eventually some idiot will blame it on the EU\u201d. Douieb isn\u2019t coy about his political views \u2013 one of the house rules is to find as many condescending ways of describing Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage as possible \u2013 and he delivers them in long, rapid-fire monologues interspersed with long, thoughtful interviews with \u201cpeople who can talk about an issue without toeing a party line, ie campaigners, charity workers\u2026\u201d Politicians aren\u2019t invited. The Skylines Podcast This weekly podcast from the New Statesman\u2019s CityMetric site may not address politics square-on, but its focus \u2013 the intensification and myriad complexities of urban life in the 21st century \u2013 raises lots of political questions. Why does Britain have a housing crisis? Why do so many people hate big capital cities? Are there really alligators in the New York sewers? The focus roves far and wide, as host Jonn Elledge and his guests consider the rapid urbanisation of China and look back at city life in Victorian London and ancient Rome. It\u2019s done with a light touch, but over nearly 100 episodes it gets to the heart of what makes a city work (or fail to do so). Killian Fox",

The advisory firm Oxford Economics said the tariffs came \u201cat a bad time for the world economy\u201d. Oxford Economics calculates that the short-term economic impact of the dispute is likely to be modest, lowering growth by a fraction of a percent in both countries. \u201cHowever, such numbers still matter, and the increased uncertainty and risks will weigh on business confidence and investment, especially cross-border investment. Thus, there will be an impact on growth, in China, the US and elsewhere, at a sensitive time for the global economy,\u201d they wrote. The escalating trade spat comes as farmers and others are increasingly concerned about the impact of a trade dispute both with China and the the US\u2019s other major trading partners. It comes after a contentious meeting of the G7 world leaders in Canada last week that ended with Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, calling the US\u2019s recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum \u201cinsulting\u201d to the countries\u2019 longstanding alliance. In retaliation the US refused to sign a joint communique following the meeting and Navarro said there was a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for any leader who engaged in \u201cbad faith diplomacy\u201d with Trump. He later apologised.",

          "body": "<p>In the lexicon of Donald Trump, the insult of choice is \u201cweak\u201d. He hurled it at Justin Trudeau last weekend, though not to his face: Trump waited till he was safely on Air Force One, having made an early exit from the G7 summit hosted by the Canadian prime minister, to tweet that Trudeau was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1005586562959093760\" title=\"\">dishonest and weak</a>\u201d on the matter of trade. Thus Trudeau joined a long list \u2013 one that includes multiple Democratic politicians, former Republican rivals and Trump\u2019s own attorney general \u2013 of those branded weak by the would-be strongman in the White House.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a professor of gender studies to spot the male insecurity that might underlie Trump\u2019s obsession with strength. He seems to specialise in projection, attributing to his opponents the very quality he most fears in himself. (Recall his insistence that Hillary Clinton was a Russian \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVWRetR4jg\" title=\"\">puppet</a>\u201d.) As one former foreign policy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rolandparis/status/1005593544629760000\" title=\"\">adviser to Trudeau</a> put it, noting the way Trump waited until he was in the air before dishing out the insults: \u201cCan\u2019t do it in person, and knows it, which makes him feel weak. So he projects these feelings on to Trudeau and then lashes out at him. You don\u2019t need to be Freud. He\u2019s a pathetic little man-child.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/15/antsy-and-bored-trump-nearly-left-kim-summit-in-peril-report-says\">'Antsy and bored' Trump nearly left Kim summit in peril, report says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But psychology only takes you so far. There\u2019s politics in this too. For Trump\u2019s insults to an elected Canadian prime minister were followed 48 hours later by a gushing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/13/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-fox-news-human-rights\" title=\"\">torrent of praise</a> for the hereditary dictator of North Korea. Kim Jong-un was not just \u201cvery talented\u201d, blessed with a \u201cgreat personality and very smart\u201d, he was also, crucially, a \u201ctough guy\u201d. As Trump explained to Fox News: \u201cHey,&nbsp;when you take over a country, tough country, with&nbsp;tough people, and you take it over from your father \u2026 if you can do that at 27 years old, that\u2019s one in 10,000 could do that.\u201d As a man who had also gone into his father\u2019s business, Donald seemed to relate. \u201cI think we understand each other,\u201d he said, adding his admiration for the \u201c<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/391776-trump-north-koreans-love-kim\" title=\"\">fervour</a>\u201d with which North Koreans greet their leader, apparently unaware that adulation of Kim in that country is not exactly voluntary.</p> \n<p>This preference for Kim \u2013 a man who murders his rivals and maintains an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/us-student-north-korea-hard-labor-camp-otto-warmbier\" title=\"\">archipelago of labour camps</a> \u2013 over Trudeau is hardly a one-off. The same Trump who becomes irritable and impatient with elected western allies can\u2019t get enough of China\u2019s unchallenged ruler, Xi&nbsp;Jinping, whom he calls a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimGoldgeier/status/1006550879074504705\" title=\"\">very special person</a>\u201d. Trump still glows when talking about the welcome he got from the dynastic dictators of Saudi Arabia, the barbaric regime currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/un-rejects-plan-to-demand-immediate-ceasefire-saudi-uae-coalition-in-yemen-port\" title=\"\">pummelling Yemen</a> in a long, cruel war.

There is a direct, selfish explanation distilled by the Nobel prizewinning economist Paul Krugman. Clocking Beijing\u2019s recent granting of 13 trademarks to <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/ap-china-approves-13-new-ivanka-trump-trademarks-in-3-months-2018-5\" title=\"\">Ivanka Trump</a>, a move that won\u2019t hurt its efforts to curry favour with her father\u2019s White House, Krugman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1005494826480136194\" title=\"\">drew the contrast</a> with the European Union, which can make no equivalent gesture, given that it approves trademarks only through a long, cumbersome process governed by rules: \u201cBrussels can\u2019t buy Trump off with de facto bribes, the way China can, because the EU has, wait for it, rule of law. So the corruption of the Trump administration inherently biases its policies toward authoritarian regimes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Put another way, Trump sees geopolitics as business, with every exchange a transaction to be judged on how much it helps him and his family. Democratic leaders, such as those Trump clashed with at the G7, make flawed business partners because they operate under constraints. They are obliged to consider international rules and alliances, longstanding norms, multiple domestic constituencies and competing interests \u2013 balancing all those against any demands Trump might make. Trudeau can\u2019t simply give Trump what he wants; the Canadian leader has to think of, say, the dairy farmers back home, whose votes he needs. That is not a pressure that weighs on the likes of Xi or Kim.</p> \n<p>And so the US president sees the leaders of China or North Korea, Russia or Saudi Arabia as strong and tough because they can make instant decisions, issuing edicts that brook no compromise \u2013 like a mafia boss or, say, the chief executive of a family-owned company. Not for them any of that limp-wristed business of compromise. Their will is sovereign.</p> \n<p>In other words, it is not any personal failing of Merkel, Trudeau or Macron that leads Trump to see each of them as weak. It is rather the very fact that they are leaders of democratic nations. For him, democracy itself is weakness.</p> \n<p>Troublingly, this view is not confined to Trump . It has seeped, however subtly, into the way plenty of democracies see themselves \u2013 Britain in the age of Brexit provides an admittedly extreme example. Theresa May is regularly branded as weak, and no wonder. As she sought this week to walk a tightrope between warring members of her own party, standing mute while Boris Johnson chuckled over his call for Trump to take over the Brexit talks, she looked like political weakness in human form: stuttering, uncertain and at the mercy of her own cabinet and party.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/14/trump-charity-sued-latest-new-york-attorney-general-violations\">Trump and family sued by New York attorney general over alleged charity violations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s easy to attribute all this to her personal limitations, which are numerous. That is the logic of those Tory MPs who seek to replace her. But the truth is, even a political titan would be flailing in May\u2019s situation: forced to implement a policy that splits both government and opposition, and which she knows will damage the country. Her problem is that there is no Brexit that can command a majority in the House of Commons. That forces her to make compromises \u2013 she has no other option. True, she is to blame for some of the constraints that now hem her in, including that lost Commons majority. But the key point is that she is in a desperately weak position.</p> \n<p>And that is less a function of personality than of the fact that May operates in a democracy, her room for manoeuvre limited by a hung parliament and a referendum vote. These are constraints that Kim, Xi and the other supposed strongmen Trump so admires will never know. No one pretends it\u2019s a pretty sight. The Brexit mess looks appalling, Britain visibly enfeebled by this act of self-harm. But if the choice is democratic weakness or a tyrant\u2019s strength, I choose weakness every time.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

          "bodyText": "In the lexicon of Donald Trump, the insult of choice is \u201cweak\u201d. He hurled it at Justin Trudeau last weekend, though not to his face: Trump waited till he was safely on Air Force One, having made an early exit from the G7 summit hosted by the Canadian prime minister, to tweet that Trudeau was \u201cdishonest and weak\u201d on the matter of trade. Thus Trudeau joined a long list \u2013 one that includes multiple Democratic politicians, former Republican rivals and Trump\u2019s own attorney general \u2013 of those branded weak by the would-be strongman in the White House. It doesn\u2019t take a professor of gender studies to spot the male insecurity that might underlie Trump\u2019s obsession with strength. He seems to specialise in projection, attributing to his opponents the very quality he most fears in himself. (Recall his insistence that Hillary Clinton was a Russian \u201cpuppet\u201d.) As one former foreign policy adviser to Trudeau put it, noting the way Trump waited until he was in the air before dishing out the insults: \u201cCan\u2019t do it in person, and knows it, which makes him feel weak. So he projects these feelings on to Trudeau and then lashes out at him. You don\u2019t need to be Freud. He\u2019s a pathetic little man-child.\u201d But psychology only takes you so far. There\u2019s politics in this too. For Trump\u2019s insults to an elected Canadian prime minister were followed 48 hours later by a gushing torrent of praise for the hereditary dictator of North Korea. Kim Jong-un was not just \u201cvery talented\u201d, blessed with a \u201cgreat personality and very smart\u201d, he was also, crucially, a \u201ctough guy\u201d. As Trump explained to Fox News: \u201cHey, when you take over a country, tough country, with tough people, and you take it over from your father \u2026 if you can do that at 27 years old, that\u2019s one in 10,000 could do that.\u201d As a man who had also gone into his father\u2019s business, Donald seemed to relate. \u201cI think we understand each other,\u201d he said, adding his admiration for the \u201cfervour\u201d with which North Koreans greet their leader, apparently unaware that adulation of Kim in that country is not exactly voluntary. This preference for Kim \u2013 a man who murders his rivals and maintains an archipelago of labour camps \u2013 over Trudeau is hardly a one-off. The same Trump who becomes irritable and impatient with elected western allies can\u2019t get enough of China\u2019s unchallenged ruler, Xi Jinping, whom he calls a \u201cvery special person\u201d. Trump still glows when talking about the welcome he got from the dynastic dictators of Saudi Arabia, the barbaric regime currently pummelling Yemen in a long, cruel war. When faced with Trudeau, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, Trump\u2019s arms remain folded. Yet when, by contrast, he meets a North Korean general, linchpin of a lethal junta, he does not hesitate to raise his arm in salute. (Those Republicans who condemned Barack Obama for bowing his head when he met the Japanese emperor have become much more forgiving these last 18 months.) What explains this preference for tyrants over elected leaders? There is a direct, selfish explanation distilled by the Nobel prizewinning economist Paul Krugman. Clocking Beijing\u2019s recent granting of 13 trademarks to Ivanka Trump, a move that won\u2019t hurt its efforts to curry favour with her father\u2019s White House, Krugman drew the contrast with the European Union, which can make no equivalent gesture, given that it approves trademarks only through a long, cumbersome process governed by rules: \u201cBrussels can\u2019t buy Trump off with de facto bribes, the way China can, because the EU has, wait for it, rule of law. So the corruption of the Trump administration inherently biases its policies toward authoritarian regimes.\u201d Put another way, Trump sees geopolitics as business, with every exchange a transaction to be judged on how much it helps him and his family. Democratic leaders, such as those Trump clashed with at the G7, make flawed business partners because they operate under constraints. They are obliged to consider international rules and alliances, longstanding norms, multiple domestic constituencies and competing interests \u2013 balancing all those against any demands Trump might make. Trudeau can\u2019t simply give Trump what he wants; the Canadian leader has to think of, say, the dairy farmers back home, whose votes he needs. That is not a pressure that weighs on the likes of Xi or Kim. And so the US president sees the leaders of China or North Korea, Russia or Saudi Arabia as strong and tough because they can make instant decisions, issuing edicts that brook no compromise \u2013 like a mafia boss or, say, the chief executive of a family-owned company. Not for them any of that limp-wristed business of compromise. Their will is sovereign. In other words, it is not any personal failing of Merkel, Trudeau or Macron that leads Trump to see each of them as weak. It is rather the very fact that they are leaders of democratic nations. For him, democracy itself is weakness. Troublingly, this view is not confined to Trump . It has seeped, however subtly, into the way plenty of democracies see themselves \u2013 Britain in the age of Brexit provides an admittedly extreme example. Theresa May is regularly branded as weak, and no wonder. As she sought this week to walk a tightrope between warring members of her own party, standing mute while Boris Johnson chuckled over his call for Trump to take over the Brexit talks, she looked like political weakness in human form: stuttering, uncertain and at the mercy of her own cabinet and party. It\u2019s easy to attribute all this to her personal limitations, which are numerous. That is the logic of those Tory MPs who seek to replace her. But the truth is, even a political titan would be flailing in May\u2019s situation: forced to implement a policy that splits both government and opposition, and which she knows will damage the country. Her problem is that there is no Brexit that can command a majority in the House of Commons. That forces her to make compromises \u2013 she has no other option. True, she is to blame for some of the constraints that now hem her in, including that lost Commons majority. But the key point is that she is in a desperately weak position. And that is less a function of personality than of the fact that May operates in a democracy, her room for manoeuvre limited by a hung parliament and a referendum vote. These are constraints that Kim, Xi and the other supposed strongmen Trump so admires will never know. No one pretends it\u2019s a pretty sight. The Brexit mess looks appalling, Britain visibly enfeebled by this act of self-harm. But if the choice is democratic weakness or a tyrant\u2019s strength, I choose weakness every time. \u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

          "bodyText": "After Justin Trudeau\u2019s surprise announcement that the Canadian government would nationalize a contentious pipeline, indigenous protesters have been among the most vocal in their opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, arguing that the project trespasses on their territory and poses a risk to the environment. Protests led by First Nations have amplified public unease of over the mega project \u2013 which will triple the flow of bitumen from Alberta to the coastal waters of British Columbia \u2013 as the country attempts to balance its fight against climate change with an economy driven largely by the energy industry. But the project may soon find an unlikely group of investors: both the Athabasca Tribal Council and the Athabasca River M\u00e9tis Council \u2013 a consortium of 10 communities \u2013 have offered to buy equity in the pipeline. \u201cThis is not the indigenous community coming out and saying: \u2018We\u2019re pro pipeline.\u2019 We\u2019re pro Trans Mountain. We see the value in it,\u201d said Ron Quintal, president of the Athabasca River M\u00e9tis. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re able to mitigate the environmental impacts is through ownership and having a say in these projects.\u201d The two councils recently met with federal officials, including the infrastructure minister, Amarjeet Sohi, to discuss their proposal. This will not be the first time Canada\u2019s First Nations have invested in the fossil fuel industries that have encroached on their land and disrupted traditional ways of life. Last year, the Fort McKay First Nation and Mikisew Cree First Nation in Alberta purchased 49% of an oil storage facility \u2013 a deal worth more than half a billion dollars. Frog Lake Energy Resources Corp, an indigenous-run company, produces 3,000 barrels of oil a day. A large source of tension around Trans Mountain project centres on the idea of unceded lands: few formal treaties were ever signed between British Columbia\u2019s colonial settlers and the indigenous population \u2013 whose descendants argue that they retain the right to control any development. And in a string of previous high-profile legal battles, courts have tended to recognize the broad powers of indigenous land title, giving First Nations a potential veto on development projects. The debate over Trans Mountain has intensified after British Columbia environmental officials recently announced that a spill from the pipeline in late May, which was initially reported to be 100 litres, was in fact 48 times larger. \u201cDespite all this insanity that Justin Trudeau is speaking, the answer is still no, we will never allow a pipeline to come through British Columbia,\u201d Elder Ta\u2019ah Amy George of the costal Tsleil-Waututh said in a statement following the government purchase of the pipeline. The pipeline\u2019s prior owner, Texas-based Kinder Morgan, actively courted indigenous support throughout the process, promising among other incentives, royalties and environmental safeguards. And according to Ernie Crey, chief of the Cheam First Nation, months of high-profile protests obscured the reality of support for the project. \u201cWe learn almost daily, as other First Nations speak out about it, that they\u2019re quite comfortable with this pipeline and they\u2019re looking forward to the benefits that will flow from its construction in terms of training, jobs and the opportunity to engage in the construction of it.\u201d He told the Guardian that his community was interested in potentially investing in the pipeline, but required more information on the project before making any commitments. To date, 43 First Nations out of more than 100 have signed agreements in support of the project. \u201cWe work very hard to ensure our territories are protected. We\u2019re the stewards of the land,\u201d said Quintal. \u201cBut at the same time, I need to make sure my members can put food on the table. I need to make sure they can get quality education and access to quality healthcare.\u201d",

He added that he hoped to withdraw US troops from South Korea at some point \u2013 further undermining the long alliance.</p> <p>Mr Trump\u2019s recounting of the meeting would have been laughable were it not so shocking. He explained to the North Koreans that they could have \u201cthe best hotels in the world\u201d on the beaches they use for artillery drills. He presented Mr Kim with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/12/trump-bizarre-trailer-for-the-summit-with-kim-singapore-bromance\" title=\"\">Hollywood-style movie trailer</a> laying out the choice before him, complete with growling voiceover. He described the 100,000 or more North Koreans held in prison camps as \u201cone of the big winners\u201d of the meeting, though not even the vaguest assurance was extracted on their behalf. While finding time for another crack at Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau, he called Mr Kim \u201ca very talented man\u201d who wants to do the right thing and loves his country. He praised him for \u201crunning it tough\u201d (quite&#xa0;the euphemism for a dictatorship with human rights atrocities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-united-nations\" title=\"\">which the UN calls unparalleled in the modern world</a>). And the comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation on which the US was to insist? Ah: \u201cThere was no time!\u201d to cover that. But he would be surprised if the North Koreans hadn\u2019t begun already. Mr Trump thinks that the two sides probably have a rough transcript capturing all this, but does not need to verify anything because \u201cI have one of the great memories of all time\u201d.

China has already implied that it may be time to relax sanctions; South Korea and Russia have hinted that they are similarly minded. Even Mr Trump acknowledged that in six months\u2019 time it may emerge that the North Koreans are not taking action (adding, in a startling moment of candour, that \u201cI will find some sort of excuse\u201d rather than admit that).</p> <p>\u201cHe trusts me and I trust him,\u201d Mr Trump boldly declared of Mr Kim.

Withdrawal from the Iran deal proved that America\u2019s enemies cannot rely upon its word.

We expect underlying inflation to trend gradually higher from here, which will prompt the Fed to hike rates twice in the second half of the year.</p> <p>A 1.7% m/m rise in gasoline prices last month pushed the energy index up by 0.9% m/m. Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%.

          "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Wage growth in the UK has slowed, in the latest sign that British households is struggling. Basic earnings rose by 2.8% per year in the February-April period, down from 2.9% a month earlier. Total pay, including bonuses, only rose by 2.5% -- meaning inflation ate virtually all the increase. Unions warned that wage growth was too slow to help families recover from the financial crisis. Economists say the wage growth slowdown cuts the chance of interest rates rising in August. The government hailed the news that employment was at a record high. Unemployment remained at a 43-year low of 4.2%. American consumers are also being hit in the pocket, with CPI inflation hitting a six-year high last month. Energy costs were a key factor, as US citizens faced higher prices at the gasoline pumps Economists say the figures mean the Federal Reserve is certain to raise interest rates at the end of this month\u2019s meeting tomorrow (on Wednesday). The markets are subdued today, as investors digest the Trump-Kim summit. The FTSE 100 is down 16 points (0.2%), while the Dow Jones industrial average is down 21 points (-0.1%). Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says markets have \u201cmore pressing concerns\u201d. The long-term importance of the Korea-U.S. summit is obvious but the event itself was always going to be something of a sideshow. All eyes were on the topic of denuclearisation, and, just as importantly facilities to verify that, but whilst North Korea\u2019s Kim Jung Un reaffirmed \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to the aim, agreements appeared vague and their scope limited. Verification was discussed, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, in a lengthy post-summit presser, but he gave no indication of whether North Korea was inclined to move towards the kind of stringent corroboration needed. So, grounds for optimism on a new North-South Korea order remain, but talks have merely confirmed there\u2019s a long grind ahead to fulfil that promise. That may be all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting, GW Rating agency Moody\u2019s says America\u2019s central bank shouldn\u2019t panic at the sight of inflation jumping further above its target: Moody\u2019s says: U.S. inflationary pressures are gradually developing, not surprising given the rise in global commodity prices, the tightening in the domestic labor market, and above-trend GDP growth. The headline consumer price index increased 0.2% in May, matching the gain in April. Food prices were unchanged, while energy rose 0.9%. Excluding food and energy, the CPI was up a trend-like 0.2%. On a year-ago basis, the headline and core CPIs increased 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. It\u2019s a slam dunk that the Fed will raise interest rates at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday, and odds favor that it signals a total of four rate hikes, rather than three, this year. Though policymakers sound hawkish, there is no immediate need to panic; the central bank should let inflation temporarily run above target. Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam UK, reckons Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes are helping to push US inflation higher. \u201cUnderlying upward pressure from tariff discussions, tax cuts and low employment has helped stoke the inflationary fires. And while the Fed won\u2019t be too concerned about inflation ticking above its target, it does pave the way for an interest rate rise later this week. \u201cTrump\u2019s anti-trade policies have certainly added to this inflationary pressure. While the US president\u2019s negotiation style has often been more bluster than action, it looks like some tariffs will go live, and he doesn\u2019t seem too concerned about the short-term effects if it has a lasting impact in the longer term. However, [Federal Reserve chair Jerome] Powell will be keeping a watchful eye on the ongoing discussions and any further effects these may have on growth and inflation.\u201d Michael Pearce of Capital Economics points out that fuel and energy are getting more expensive: The increase in headline inflation to a six-year high of 2.8% in May is partly due to the rally in energy prices, but it is also reflects another solid monthly gain in core CPI, which will keep the Fed on course to raise interest rates tomorrow. We expect underlying inflation to trend gradually higher from here, which will prompt the Fed to hike rates twice in the second half of the year. A 1.7% m/m rise in gasoline prices last month pushed the energy index up by 0.9% m/m. Thanks also to the base effects caused by the 5.3% m/m drop in gasoline prices in May of last year, that rise in energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation up to 2.8%, from 2.5%. With crude oil prices stabilising in recent weeks, gasoline prices are likely to be more neutral for inflation over the rest of the year. Inflation is devouring most of America\u2019s pay rises, flags up economist Ulrik Bie: Greg Daco of Oxford Economics predicts America\u2019s central bankers will raise interest rates twice more this year, starting tomorrow. This chart from Bloomberg shows how US inflation has now running over the official 2% target for months, and is now at its highest level since 2012: BREAKING: Prices in America are rising at their fastest pace since 2012. The US consumer prices index rose to 2.8% per annum in May, up from 2.5% in April. That\u2019s a little higher than expected, and the highest inflation rate since February 2012. It surely means the Federal Reserve is certain to raise US interest rates on Wednesday. Prices rose by 0.2% during the month. Core inflation (which strips out volatile items) rose to 2.2%, another sign that inflationary pressure are building. European stock markets continue to be underwhelmed by the results of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un\u2019s historic summit in Singapore. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped into the red - down 20 points at 7718. The Frankfurt and Parisian markets are looking becalmed too. It\u2019s a lacklustre response to what Trump claimed was a \u201cvery important event in world history\u201d. However, it\u2019s not clear that the US president has achieved much, in return for granting Kim such as high-profile meeting. North Korea\u2019s commitment to \u201ccomplete denuclearisation\u201d sounds good, but today\u2019s agreement doesn\u2019t include concrete targets. Of course, it will take more than one meeting to reach a truly momentous deal. Here\u2019s our analysis: There\u2019s also some surprise that Donald Trump has agreed to suspend \u201cWar Games\u201d in the region, on the grounds they are expensive, provocative and inappropriate. Dr Moritz Pieper, an expert in International Relations at the University of Salford, sees a long road ahead: \u201cThe historic meeting between Trump and Kim can be a first step in a longer-term process that might eventually see a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula and North Korean denuclearisation. \u201cBut both sides have different views of what denuclearisation means. The US line has always been that it wants to see complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme in return for aid and sanctions lifting \u2013 or relief. \u201cBut North Korea is unlikely to agree to give up its nuclear weapons. This is seen as North Korea\u2019s security guarantee \u2013 the nuclear deterrent is seen as key for regime survival. The president of ZEW, Achim Wambach, reckons German investors are being spooked by geopolitical perils: Explaining today\u2019s drop in sentiment, Wambach says: \u201cThe latest escalation in the trade dispute with the United States and fears about policies by the new Italian government that could destabilize the financial system are leaving their mark on the outlook for Germany. In another alarming development, optimism among German investors has sunk to its lowest in nearly six years. The ZEW institute\u2019s monthly index of morale has slumped to -16.1, down from the -8.2 recorded in May, and the lowest level since September 2012. The trade dispute between Europe and the US, and the election of a populist government in Italy, could be a nasty cocktail for German investors. They\u2019ve also seen exports and factory production fall this year, a sign that Europe\u2019s largest economy may be slowing down. Economists are concerned... The broader picture is that UK wages are still below their pre-financial crisis levels in real terms, and struggling to catch up: Public sector pay packets have lagged behind since 2015, \u2018thanks\u2019 to the government\u2019s pay cap on nurses, teachers et al. They suffered the brunt of the fall in real wages last year, as inflation ravaged pay packets. The slowdown in UK wage growth last month will concern the Bank of England, which has predicted that earnings will accelerate in 2018. Weak economic growth in the first quarter of this year prevented the BoE from raising interest rates in May. If wage growth remains weak, it could deter a rate hike this summer too. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, suspects that UK interest rates may remain at 0.5% until 2019. The Bank views wage growth as a key indicator when considering whether to raise rates. Disappointing figures here, combined with confirmation that the economy grew by just 0.1% in Q1, should put paid to any talk of a summer rate rise. Policymakers had been thought to be considering raising rates in August, but I still think a rate rise this year looks unlikely. The Bank will almost certainly want confirmation that the Q1 growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. Women taking part-time jobs makes up the biggest proportion of job creation in the last year, followed by men taking full-time jobs. This helped to push the female employment rate to a record high of 71.3% (compared to 80% for men). Young Women\u2019s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton OBE says more help is needed: \u201cThe record rate of women\u2019s employment is welcome, although the Office for National Statistics has pointed out that this is in part due to women retiring later. At the other end of the scale, young women are struggling to find work and make ends meet. \u201cYoung women tell us they want to work and be able to live independently but today\u2019s figures show that nearly half a million are still out of work and full-time education \u2013 11,000 more than this time last year. Esther McVey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, says the steady job labour market is a \u201csuccess story\u201d: \u201cThe employment rate has never been higher \u2013 with over 3.3 million people moving into work since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s a Great British success story with businesses from Exeter to Edinburgh creating jobs \u2013 helping, on average 1,000 people find a job each and every day since 2010. \u201cAnd with the increase in the personal tax allowance, this Government has ensured that people are keeping more of their money before they begin paying tax \u2013 meaning more take-home pay, that\u2019s more money in your pocket for you and your family. At just 2.8%, UK pay growth is well below the 4.5% enjoyed in the run-up to the financial crisis. Conor D\u2019Arcy, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, says earnings growth remains disappointing: \u201cThe UK jobs market has continued to impress in 2018, with employment remaining at a record high and female unemployment falling to its lowest ever level. \u201cBut we\u2019re yet to see the good news on jobs feed into wage pressure, with nominal pay growth still below 3%. \u201cWhile the easing of inflationary pressures is helping pay packets to stretch that little bit further, there is still no sign of a long overdue pay rebound in Britain.\u201d Industrial unrest hit a record low in April, with fewer walkouts than ever before. The ONS reports that: there were 3,000 working days lost from five stoppages in April 2018, the lowest number of stoppages since monthly records began in January 1931 1,000 people took strike action, one of the lowest figures on record This highlights how union power has waned in Britain in recent years -- perhaps one reason that wage growth is now so mediocre. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is worried that UK wage growth is slowing: \u201cWhile pay is still outpacing price growth, the slowdown in earnings growth is a concern. Delivering sustained rises in real pay growth is likely to prove an uphill struggle amid weak productivity and a sluggish economy. As a consequence, household finances are likely to remain stretched, particularly given weak household savings and high debt levels. The slowdown in earnings growth, together with the recent weakness in a raft of other economic indicators, undermines the case for tightening monetary policy. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, fears that the UK labour market may have peaked. \u201cThe juxtaposition of today\u2019s increase in the employment rate to a record 75.6% and yesterday\u2019s news of lay-offs at both Poundworld and Jaguar Land Rover will be lost on nobody and we think that today\u2019s jobs report could soon be revealed as a high water mark for job creation.\u201d \u201cThe recent claimant count trend has been increasing \u2013 it sits at 3\u00bd year high currently - and employment readings within the PMI sentiment surveys have been deteriorating so an increase in joblessness soon would not come as surprise. This could also contribute to a slowing of wage gains, something that we have seen already this month.\u201d This wage slowdown means that real basic pay growth in the UK (basic earnings minus inflation) remains just 0.4%. And total real pay growth is zero -- with inflation eating up pay and bonuses. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has warned that wage growth is \u201cstuck in the slow lane\u201d. At this rate pay packets won\u2019t recover to their pre-recession levels for years. \u201cWe need to speed things up. Extending collective bargaining would boost living standards and help workers get a fairer share of the wealth they create. The number of unemployed people in the UK dropped by 38,000 in the last quarter, to 1.42 million. Today\u2019s jobs data is weaker than expected, says Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce: Britain\u2019s employment rate has now been at a record high of 75.6% for two months running - a record dating back to at least 1971. At 4.2%, the unemployment rate hasn\u2019t been lower since March-May 1975: But this apparent strength is not reaching workers\u2019 pockets. Regular pay growth is now dropping, having hit its highest level since 2015 last month. Newsflash: Wage growth in the UK has slowed, even though the economy continues to create jobs. Basic pay growth slowed to 2.8% per year in the three months to April, the latest labour market report shows. That\u2019s down from 2.9% a month ago, suggesting that wage growth is faltering. Total pay growth (including bonuses) also slowed, to 2.5% from 2.6%. The unemployment rate, though, remains at just 4.2% - its lowest level in 43 years. And the economy continued to create jobs -- 146,000 new workers were taken on in the last quarter, down from 197,000 in the January-March quarter. The ONS says: There were 32.39 million people in work, 146,000 more than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 440,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 years who were in work) was 75.6%, higher than for a year earlier (74.8%) and the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.42 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 38,000 fewer than for November 2017 to January 2018 and 115,000 fewer than for a year earlier. More to follow! Economist Shaun Richards says we should watch out for total wage growth in today\u2019s jobs report (that\u2019s pay including bonuses). It dropped to 2.6% last month, down from 2.8%. Overnight, Larry Kudlow - the director of Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council - was hospitalised after suffering a heart attack. Trump broke the news on Twitter, shortly before his summit with Kim. Kudlow, a former TV personality and Wall Street economist, only joined the White House in March. He\u2019s an important advisor to Trump, and a supporter of free trade, and it\u2019s not clear who might cover his duties while he recuperates. Kudlow hit the headlines on Sunday after accusing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of \u201cessentially double-crossing President Trump\u201d. Paul Donovan of UBS thinks investors should focus on the crisis at the G7, rather than Trumps\u2019s meeting with Kim. He explains: The US president seems to have a better relationship with the North Korean leader than with the Canadian leader. Markets don\u2019t care too much about North Korea. Markets do care about US relations with Canada. Sue Trinh of RBC says investors shouldn\u2019t get too excited by Kim\u2019s pledge to work towards \u2018complete denuclearisation\u201d of the Korean peninsula. Both sides stand far, far apart on what denuclearisation means. To the US, it means NK must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means NK suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the US stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region (basically dismantling its alliance with South Korea and ultimately the region as a whole). Kim has never announced the intention of abandoning his existing nuclear arsenal, which he calls a \u201ctreasured sword\u201d. Per previous peace deals, the main issue will be the pace of implementation, which includes agreement on a verification protocol. South Korean President Moon suggested it could be the start of a process lasting up to two years or longer. So let\u2019s get back to what really matters for markets for the time being \u2013 next up, US CPI, voting on the EU Withdrawal Bill and the FOMC and ECB meetings. European stock markets have opened higher as traders digest the historic US-North Korea summit in Singapore. After holding hours of talks, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have sat down before the world\u2019s media and signed a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 agreement, pledging to work towards peace on the Korean peninsula. Photos of the document also show that North Korea has committed to \u201cwork towards\u201d complete denuclearisation. That\u2019s a welcome aspiration, but not a full-blooded commitment it will actually happen. Kim hasn\u2019t agreed to any explicit missile reductions, for example. But still, the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.4% in early trading, on relief that the Singapore event has gone better than the G7 summit. Trump declared that the two leaders had enjoyed a \u201creally fantastic meeting\u201d, while Kim spoke about \u201ca big prelude to peace\u201d. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is up a modest 6 points. We\u2019re tracking all the developments here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we learn how Britain\u2019s labour market is faring, as the warning lights flash on the UK economy. Overnight, recruitment firm ManpowerGroup has reported that company bosses are at their most pessimistic since 2012 -- due to worries over Brexit and the high street slowdown. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Watched by the Bank of England and the government for early warnings of hiring spurts or downturns, the quarterly poll of about 2,000 major employers from nine different industry sectors across the UK found a net balance of only 4% planning to hire more staff rather than cutting back. The weakest outlook from the survey was reserved for the banking and finance industry, which recorded the worst outlook since the depths of the financial crisis almost a decade ago, suggesting job cuts may be on the way over the summer. With manufacturing output hitting a six-year low yesterday, and construction output also disappointing, the economy appears to be at its weakest point since the eurozone crisis was raging six years ago. So, today\u2019s unemployment figures will be scrutinised for signs of weakness. Economists are expecting the jobless rate to remain at 4.2% in April, a 43-year low, with basic pay rises unchanged at 2.9%. But, the number of jobs created over the last quarter could drop to around 110,000, from 197,000 in the three months to March. That could signal that the labour market is cooling. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: Even though there have been a number of large surprises to the upside in the employment data over the last six months, it will be very difficult for gains in employment to match last month\u2019s very strong +197k 3/3m. For the unemployment rate, we expect it to remain at 4.2% for a third consecutive month. As ever, average wages will be the more closely watched measure, but on this occasion we don\u2019t expect major changes and look for the excluding-bonus measure to remain 2.9% 3m/yr. Also coming up today It\u2019s a big day for Brexit, as parliament votes on an amendment to give MPs give parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. This would put the House of Commons in charge if MPs were to reject the government\u2019s final divorce deal was rejected by MPs into the hands of the Commons. It aims to avoid MPs facing a choice between the government\u2019s deal or no deal, but Brexiters fear it could lead to a second referendum. Sterling could be volatile if Theresa May fails to block the amendment. We also get the latest American inflation figures. The annual US CPI is expected to rise to 2.7%, from 2.5% in May, as the cost of living accelerates. The US Federal Reserve is already expected to raise interest rates tomorrow, following a two-day meeting starting today.

          "bodyText": "Late-night hosts on Monday discussed last weekend\u2019s G7 summit, where tensions broke out between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau, as well as Tuesday\u2019s highly anticipated summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un. Stephen Colbert \u201cFolks, it is an historic evening because as we speak President Trump is meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un,\u201d Stephen Colbert began, noting that the situation would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d just a few years ago. \u201cTensions are high and the United States is on the precipice of unthinkable international conflict,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cand that\u2019s with Canada. Our relations have not been bad with Canada since they stole the word \u2018bacon\u2019. Canadian bacon is just round ham, you monsters. \u201cIf you\u2019re one of those nerds out there who values the western alliance that has safeguarded democracy for 70 years, it was a tough weekend for you,\u201d the host continued, noting the ongoing tensions between the US and its trading partners over the protectionist trade tariffs Trump declared shortly before the summit. \u201cThat\u2019s like showing up to an AA meeting with Captain Morgan.\u201d The host then showed the viral image of the summit, saying of Trump\u2019s posture, \u201cIt\u2019s like a toddler who put a Lego in his mouth.\u201d He continued: \u201cThese meetings, every time they end with what\u2019s called a joint communique, an agreement of intention between the nations. Trump agreed to sign it but after he left, Justin Trudeau said this about imposing tariffs on the US.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister told reporters retaliatory tariffs are \u201cnot something we relish doing\u201d, but added that Canada \u201cwill not be pushed around\u201d. In response, Trump called Trudeau \u201cmeek\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d on Twitter while his director of trade, Peter Navarro, said there is \u201ca special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy\u201d with Trump. \u201cCanadian hell,\u201d Colbert quipped, \u201cwhere Bud Light is on tap, they never play Gordon Lightfoot, and you have to choose between Ryan Reynolds and Ryan Gosling.\u201d Trevor Noah Trevor Noah also covered the G7, \u201cwhen America and its closest allies come together for two days of meetings on economic issues\u201d. Before the summit, Noah explained, Trump told reporters Russia should be allowed back into what was the G8 after being dismissed for the invasion of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump colluded with Russia, but if everyone was accusing me of colluding with Russia, I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead mentioning their name,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut, clearly, Trump doesn\u2019t know how to take a clue.\u201d When asked about the annexation of Crimea, Trump blamed the Obama administration and reiterated his desire to have Russia rejoin the G8. \u201cOK, that makes sense,\u201d Noah said. \u201cRussia annexing Crimea wasn\u2019t really a big deal, but we must never forgive Obama for letting them commit the atrocity, which was not a big deal at all.

Noah went on: \u201cThe reason Trump went all Pusha-T on Trudeau is because he claims that Trudeau was super nice to him in person but then as soon as Trump left, Trudeau held a press conference saying that Canada still planned to retaliate against the new US tariffs.\u201d The host then showed news segments in which Trump advisers escalated the conflict between the president and Trudeau, with Larry Kudlow accusing Trudeau of stabbing America in the back and Navarro making his \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d remark. \u201cThat is a serious threat and a very specific place in hell,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThat sounds VIP as shit.\u201d Seth Meyers Finally, Seth Meyers addressed Trump\u2019s comfort with authoritarian leaders and his contempt for America\u2019s allies. \u201cThe Trump administration has now said harsher things about Canada than they\u2019ve ever said about Russia, which actually did attack our political system,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cCompare Trump\u2019s comments about Canada to what he said just last week about Russia.\u201d Of Trump\u2019s desire to bring Russia to the negotiating table, Meyers said: \u201cRussia was kicked out of what used to be called the G8 for illegally invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea.

Meyers then explained how Trump saved a Chinese state-owned cellphone company that had been sanctioned by Congress after the Chinese government agreed to grant $500m in loans to an Indonesian resort project from which Trump stands to profit. \u201cTrump is much more comfortable with authoritarian leaders because, unlike our democratically elected allies, authoritarians can easily win Trump over by lining his pockets,\u201d Meyers said, adding that \u201cChina has also approved 13 new Ivanka Trump trademarks in three months.\u201d",

Could it have been clearing the decks for a critical report from the <strong>Electoral Commission</strong> about the role of some of Theresa May\u2019s senior aides in the Vote Leave campaign?</p> <p>Evidence from whistleblowers Chris Wylie and Sahmir Sanni appeared to suggest coordination between Vote Leave, the officially designated Brexit campaign, and the nominally separate BeLeave group. If the commission finds that Vote Leave was effectively directing the group of young Brexit campaigners, it could be a breach of election funding rules. The commission is believed to be examining the roles of May\u2019s political secretary Stephen Parkinson, and Cleo Watson, another Number 10 adviser, both of whom held senior posts in Vote Leave - which was chaired by Michael Gove.</p> <p>Those involved in Vote Leave have always strongly denied wrongdoing, insisting that Vote Leave and BeLeave were separate and that they acted in accordance with the rules.</p> <p>The government has now confirmed to Labour MP Bridget Phillipson in a parliamentary question that those criticised in its ongoing investigation have been given 28 days\u2019 warning of its findings. Rumours at Westminster suggest the report could be scheduled for publication on Wednesday - though the commission has not yet confirmed a date.</p> <p>Watson said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Each day the plot thickens about the murky dealings of the various Brexit campaigns. Now it seems senior figures at the heart of Number 10 who were involved in Vote Leave could have been informed about the contents of this important Electoral Commission investigation long before anyone else. If that\u2019s true, Number 10 would have had time to plan and even ensure key Brexit votes like the ones this week could happen before the investigation findings are published.

          "bodyText": "Arron Banks, the financial backer of the unofficial Brexit campaign, says there was possibly collusion between Russia and the Trump or Brexit campaigns \u201cat a low level\u201d. But he denies taking money from Moscow and says the recent newspaper article have been part of a \u201ccampaign to smear anyone involved in the Brexit campaign\u201d. Banks insists there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of financial backing by Moscow. His communications director, Andy Wigmore, says \u201cnot one penny or rouble\u201d was handed over. Banks and Wigmore confirm they put the Russian ambassador in London in contact with the Trump transition team. Wigmore says the Russian government was simply unprepared for Trump\u2019s victory. Following the LBC interview, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, says Banks\u2019s Russian connections are being examined \u201cvery seriously\u201d by ministers. They want to establish if there was an attempt to undermine parliamentary democracy during the Brexit campaign, he said. You can read the full story here: The prime minister has been meeting the influential Tory backbench 1922 Committee, along with ministers \u2013 including the Treasurer, Philip Hammond, and the Brexit secretary, David Davis. She warned Conservative MPs that defeats over the Brexit bill would undermine her negotiating position with Brussels. May told them: We must think about the message parliament will send to the European Union this week. I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible. But, if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined. Read the full story by Pippa Crerar, Heather Stewart and Lisa O\u2019Carroll here: Earlier today, my colleague Jim Waterson put together a profile of Isabel Oakeshott, the journalist who has said she was aware of emails linking Arron Banks to Russian officials and businessmen at the end of last year \u2013 but did not publish the information until recently. Farage has concluded his interview with Banks and Wigmore. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. In the meantime, Heather Stewart has been looking at the internal divisions in the Labour party over its position on EEA membership. It\u2019s worth a read: Farage asks Banks if there was collusion between Russia and the Trump or Brexit campaigns. Banks replies: I think it\u2019s possible at a low level \u2013 when we talked about these bots and the things that the Russians were trying to do. But at a very, sort of, amateur level. I really think that the reason this is all coming out is because it\u2019s a concerted remain campaign to smear anyone involved in the Brexit campaign. Banks tells Farage: \u201cWhere is the evidence that we took Russian money? There\u2019s no evidence.\u201d Asked if he is in for a \u201ctough time of it\u201d, Banks says it is the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee that may find themselves in difficulty. He says the chair, Damian Collins, \u201chad to disclose a donation from Roman Abramovich ... Putin\u2019s man in London\u201d. He is referring to an entry placed on the register of members\u2019 interests last Wednesday, in which Collins declared receipt of \u201ctwo tickets, including hospitality, for Chelsea vs Crystal Palace with a total value of \u00a31,060\u201d from the Abramovich-owned Chelsea Football Club. Farage asks: Was there, at any point, Russian \u2013 or Russian individuals, or Russian businesses that gave money to Leave.EU? Wigmore: \u201cNo. Not one penny or rouble.\u201d Banks is asked about handing the Russians the telephone numbers of members of the Trump transition team, which he acknowledges. Wigmore, the communications director for the Leave.EU campaign, interjects to add \u201ccontext\u201d. He says the Trump transition team needed phone numbers for foreign governments and was given one he could hand out to them. He claims the Russians, like many governments, did not expect Trump to win and had not prepared for that eventuality. It was in that context, he says, that the phone number was handed over. Asked if he was \u201creporting back\u201d to the Russian ambassador on the meeting the three men held with then president elect Trump, Banks says: Not really, we\u2019d had a very pleasant lunch with him that lasted six hours. And, of course, he saw a picture of us and the golden doors of Trump\u2019s apartment and, of course he got in touch with Andy [Wigmore] because he\u2019d seen us splashed all over the newspapers. He adds: It\u2019s complete nonsense .. we had two lunches and a cup of tea. At the lunch, he [the Russian ambassador] was interested in Trump for the same reasons ... he couldn\u2019t believe that Trump had been elected ... We were asked for numbers of the transition team to get in contact. Asked by Farage if he was using the Brexit campaign for his financial gain, Banks tells him: Not really. We went there to have this lunch with the Russian ambassador, we had it after Trump. He was interested in the election of Trump. When we\u2019d had the original meeting, relating to Brexit, he was fascinated by the Brexit campaign. In fact, he thought it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Farage is just getting underway with a monologue, saying Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore will appear before the Commons select committee tomorrow. He asks Banks about claims he met the Russian ambassador. Banks says he was approached at the Ukip conference in Doncaster and asked if he wanted lunch with the ambassador. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, calling subsequent coverage a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. He says it would be a strange conspiracy if he had revealed it in his own book. He says the second meeting wasn\u2019t mentioned in his book because it came after the end of the timeline. Banks says he had \u201ctwo lunches and one cup of tea\u201d with the ambassador. Hello, we resume our coverage this evening with the appearances of Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore on Nigel Farage\u2019s LBC radio show. The trio were previously involved with the same pro-Brexit campaign group, Leave.EU. Tory rebel remainers have warned Theresa May that her changes to the EU withdrawal bill before its return to the House of Commons this week do not go far enough to head off a revolt. Theresa May has used a Commons statement on the G7 summit to give her backing to the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau following his row with the American president, Donald Trump. (See 5.04pm.) She also reaffirmed the EU\u2019s decision to retaliate for the \u201cunjustified\u201d tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said the people of Northern Ireland do not want their abortion laws changed by Westminster. Speaking to the Press Association, she said: It\u2019s another example of why the [Stormont] executive needs to be reformed, so those politicians representing the people Northern Ireland, understanding their views on this very, very sensitive issue can make sure the law is right for them .... My conversations with people here [in Northern Ireland] is that they want their voice to be heard and they want their politicians, who they elected, to represent them and to develop laws around abortion that are right for Northern Ireland. If I have heard one view I\u2019ve heard 100 different views about what that law should look like. But there is one thing that\u2019s absolutely certain - politicians at Westminster are not the people qualified to determine what the law looks like. It absolutely should be done in Stormont. The government should expand the number of countries whose citizens are eligible to apply for a working holiday visa to the UK, a Conservative thinktank has said. That\u2019s all from me for today. A colleague will be taking for developments this evening. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, will be interviewing his Leave.EU pals Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore on his LBC phone-in this evening, he has announced on Twitter. The government may be tabling a new amendment to the EU withdrawal bill in the hope of appeasing potential rebels, the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports. We have some new Guardian/ICM polling out today. The questions covered leadership qualities and voting intention. Leadership qualities We asked about eight leadership qualities and, on each measure, we asked whether Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn did best. Theresa May is generally seen as outperforming Jeremy Corbyn on key leadership qualities, often by large margins, a Guardian/ICM poll suggests. May had large leads over Corbyn on four qualities: taking tough decisions (30pt lead), being competent (20pt), being a strong leader (20pt) and being more intelligent (16pt). Corbyn had more modest leads on three qualities: standing up for what they believe in (16pt), understanding people like me (14pt) and being likeable (6pt). On one final measure, they were almost tied. Asked who was most trustworthy, 51% said May, and 49% said Corbyn, giving May a 2pt lead. ICMs Alex Turk says the detailed figures show remain supporters and leave supporters answer the trust question differently. He writes: Generally, those that support a party also have more favourable views of its leader \u2013 at least when compared to the opposition. So it\u2019s not surprising that those who voted Labour are more likely to think Corbyn is trustworthy and those who voted Conservative think the same about Theresa May, regardless of EU referendum vote. Indeed Theresa May scores higher among Tory leavers (77%) than Conservative remainers (70%). These are fairly healthy proportions on both scores \u2013 but maybe, just maybe, that slightly higher score from Conservative leavers could be seen as a vindication of May\u2019s message discipline when routinely insisting that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Corbyn score fairly well among Labour remainers, of whom 73% think he is more trustworthy than May. But this score drops by a full ten percentage points to 63% when asked of Labour leavers. And at least part of this could be ascribed to the increased proportion of don\u2019t knows \u2013 almost 3 in 10 Labour leavers (29%) don\u2019t know which leader is more trustworthy, compared to less than 1 in 5 Conservative leavers (19%). Voting intention The Conservatives have a two-point lead over Labour, down 1 point from when ICM polled on this two weeks ago, the poll suggests. Here are the figures: Conservatives: 42% (down 1) Labour: 40% (no change) Lib Dems: 8% (no change) Greens: 3% (up 1) Ukip: 3% (no change) (This post went up earlier, but one of the graphics was garbled, and so we had to take it down. Apologies if you saw it and have been wondering where it went.) ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,021 adults aged 18+, between 8 and 10 June 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. I will post the tables here later when they go up on the ICM website. My colleague Peter Walker has translated some of the lines in May\u2019s statement into what-it-really-means English. Here are the main points from May\u2019s statement. May explicitly praised the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau for the way he managed the G7 summit. As was clear over the weekend, there was strong debate, and disagreement on some issues. But after detailed discussions between both leaders and our teams, we were able to find common ground and draw up a communique which reflected these discussions and the agreements we reached. I want to pay a particular tribute to Prime Minister Trudeau for his leadership and skilful chairing, which enabled us - after two days of negotiation between leaders - to agree actions and a shared approach on some of the most pressing challenges facing the international community and our citizens. May\u2019s comments seemed as an implicit rebuke to the White House after a Trump adviser said, at the end of the G7 summit, that there was \u201ca special place in hell\u201d for the Canadian prime minister because he had shown \u201cbad faith\u201d and stabbed Trump in the back. But when May was asked by Jeremy Corbyn to explicitly criticise those comments, she sidestepped the question. She said the UK \u201cfully intends to honour the commitments we have made\u201d - implicitly criticising President Trump for saying he would not endorse the summit communique. She reaffirmed the EU\u2019s decision to retaliate for the \u201cunjustified\u201d tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminium. We need to make the international rules-based trading system work better, so the benefits of free trade can be felt by all. And that includes encouraging the World Trade Organisation to operate more effectively in supporting a global economy that works for everyone. Multilateral action is the right way to achieve this. It cannot be done by taking unilateral action against your partners. So at this summit, we expressed deep disappointment at the unjustified decision of the United States to apply tariffs to steel and aluminium imports. The loss of trade through tariffs undermines competition, reduces productivity, removes the incentive to innovate \u2013 and ultimately makes everyone poorer. And in response, the EU will impose countermeasures. But she also said she did not want to see a trade war escalate. We need to avoid a continued tit-for-tat escalation. That is why it was right that we had such an open and direct discussion at this summit. And why, as a champion of free trade, the UK will continue to support a constructive dialogue. As long-standing allies we do not make progress by ignoring each other\u2019s concerns; but rather by addressing them together. The Conservative Crispin Blunt asks a short three-word question: Trudeau or Trump? May jokes that she does not know what activities Blunt might be referring to. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson asks if the special relationship with the US is stronger or weaker with President Trump in the White House. May says is continues to be strong. And because it is strong, the UK can tell the US when it disagrees with what it is doing, she says. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says he wants to spoil the consensus. Trump has got a point, hasn\u2019t he? China is building up a massive trade surplus, he says. May says the emerging countries which are not playing by the rules-based order need to be brought within it. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant says there is a growing trend towards protectionism in the world. May says she agrees that any moves to extent protectionism are worrying. But the debate on this focuses on tariffs, she says. She says trade is about more than tariffs. She does not want to see tariffs replaced by other barriers to trade. Here is the text of May\u2019s statement. UPDATE: Sorry, this link is to the statement May delivered at the end of the summit on Saturday. I will post a link to today\u2019s statement when it goes up on the Number 10 website. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw asks how May reponded when Trump said Russia should be let back in. And shouldn\u2019t the police now investigate links between Russia and the leave campaign? May says that the police investigate is up to them. She says Russia was kicked out of the G8 after the annexation of Crimea. She says she has opposed letting it back in until it changes its attitude. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, asks what is the point of the G7. The most powerful member does not believe in a rules-based system. And India and China are not involved. Shouldn\u2019t it be closed down? May says Cable should look at the conference communique. Sir Michael Fallon, the Conservative former defence secretary, asks how the rapid response mechanism set up at the G7 to respond to Russian aggression will work. May says there will be faster attribution when Russia does something. And then the G7 countries will work together to retaliate. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn says, under May\u2019s Brexit backstop plan, the UK will remain in a customs union with the EU until the end of 2021 or longer. May says the point of the backstop is that it is there in case new trade rules are not in place. She says she wants new arrangements to be in place by the end of 2020. She hopes the backstop won\u2019t be used. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says despite the difficulties at the summit, it did show the importance of multinational organisations. He says it also showed why her cabinet colleagues are wrong to depend on Trump to offer a good trade deal with the UK after Brexit. May says the UK has been speaking to the US about such a trade deal. The government believes open markets are the best way to bring jobs, she says. She wants to do trade deals in the interests of the UK. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, says the G7 summit shows President Trump has little time for multilateral summits. Doesn\u2019t May reflect on how it went, and realise how important it is to keep as much of the benefits of the EU single market as possible. We will need it in the future, he says. May is responding to Corbyn. She says some of the issues he raised did not come up at the summit. On relations with the US, she says the US did support the UK after the Salisbury nerve agent attack. What is important is that the two countries can talk about these issues, she says. She says she has been very clear to Trump that she thinks the steel and aluminium tariffs are unjustified. But it is important not to have continuous tit-for-tat retaliation, she says. That is why it is important to keep talking, she says. She says Labour\u2019s policy would hand over negotiation of trade deals to the EU. Jeremy Corbyn says the summit was a failure. President Trump was to blame, he says. The problem is that is is pursusing a policy of America first. He says attempts to engage with the US have failed. He says the UK should never outsource policy to the US. He asks May to condemn the Trump adviser who said Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, deserved a special place in hell. He expresses concern that Jaguar Land Rover is moving production of the Discovery to Slovakia. He asks if the summit discussed the migrants on the ship Aquarius. He praises Spain for taking them in. May says she expressed deep disappointment at the US\u2019s decision to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU. She says the tariffs were unjustified. They will make everyone poorer, she says. She says the EU will retaliate. Theresa May is making her Commons statement on the G7 summit. There was strong discussion and disagreement on some issue, she says. She says that, as a result of discussion between the leaders and their teams, there were able to agree on a communique. She praises Justin Trudeau, the summit chair, of his leadership. And she says the UK intends to honour the commitments it made. Sir Craig Oliver, David Cameron\u2019s former communications chief, thinks Theresa May looks \u201cstronger\u201d and \u201cmore human\u201d after using her Evening Standard article (see 11.55am) to say she was wrong not to meet survivors when she first visited Grenfell Tower after the fire. According to a report for Business Insider, the Lib Dems are expecting to come a \u201cstrong\u201d second in the Lewisham East byelection on Thursday. That would be a good result for party that got just 4% of the vote there in the general election. Labour, which had a majority of 21,123 in 2017, with 68% of the vote, is widely expected to win. The European commission has said the UK government\u2019s Brexit backstop plan published last week would still lead to the creation of a hard border in Ireland. (See 1.38pm.) Theresa May is to urge her MPs to send a message of unity over Brexit this week by reversing Lords amendments to the EU withdrawal bill, with senior government figures saying they are confident a revolt can be headed off. A \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d no-deal Brexit is becoming ever more possible, Vince Cable has warned, saying that if this happened it would be an unprecedented policy disaster. The UK is to apply to stay in the European standards system for industry products and services after Brexit, following warnings from business that creating British-only benchmarks would be \u201can isolationist move\u201d that would pile costs on to companies, the Financial Times (paywall) is reporting. Jacob Rees-Mogg has said that there would be no need for customs checks at Dover on EU imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, suggesting that any delays for exports to Europe would be France\u2019s responsibility. Experts says he\u2019s wrong. This is from a Labour MEP. And this is from a law professor. Theresa May has admitted her initial response to the Grenfell Tower fire was not good enough, saying she will \u201calways regret\u201d not meeting survivors of the blaze when she first visited the site. Kensington and Chelsea council has worsened the trauma of many Grenfell survivors by taking far too long to rehouse them through a string of errors, according to a community aid association that has helped many families. Dozens of Afghan interpreters who served on the front-line alongside British troops are to be given the right to settle in the UK, Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has announced. As the Press Association reports, changes to the government\u2019s relocation scheme mean more volunteers who served in Helmand province will be granted visas in recognition of their \u201cunflinching courage\u201d at carrying out duties \u201cfraught with great difficulty and danger\u201d, Williamson said. They will be allowed to start a new life in Britain alongside their wives and children - with approximately 200 new visas set to be issued. Downing Street has said that President Trump should honour the commitments he made at the G7 summit. (See 11.37am.) On Friday, at his press conference in Brussels, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, raised various problems with the UK\u2019s Brexit backstop plan, although afterwards he posted a message insisting that he was not rejecting it out of hand. Today the commission has published a slideshow presentation (pdf) highlighting objections to the UK plan. It repeats the points made by Barnier on Friday, but also goes further. Technically it might not amount to an absolute rejection, but it is almost as good as. Here is the final slide with the commission\u2019s conclusion. The commission says the UK plan, as published, would still require a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. UK Brexit backstop plan as published would lead still lead to hard border in Ireland, says the European commission. It is worth stressing \u201cas published\u201d because the document published by the government on Friday said explicitly that it was just a proposal \u201cfor the customs element of the backstop\u201d. But a backstop would have to cover regulatory alignment too. According to reports, one idea is for the final element of the backstop plan to involve Northern Ireland staying in regulatory alignment with the single market, but not the rest of the UK. The European commission has also published an infographic (pdf) explaining why its own backstop plan would solve the border problem. There is an urgent question in the Commons on Yemen at 3.30pm. Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson has an intriguing hunch about why the government was originally so keen to push the EU withdrawal bill through the Commons in a single day (a backlash later forced it to offer two). Could it have been clearing the decks for a critical report from the Electoral Commission about the role of some of Theresa May\u2019s senior aides in the Vote Leave campaign? Evidence from whistleblowers Chris Wylie and Sahmir Sanni appeared to suggest coordination between Vote Leave, the officially designated Brexit campaign, and the nominally separate BeLeave group. If the commission finds that Vote Leave was effectively directing the group of young Brexit campaigners, it could be a breach of election funding rules. The commission is believed to be examining the roles of May\u2019s political secretary Stephen Parkinson, and Cleo Watson, another Number 10 adviser, both of whom held senior posts in Vote Leave - which was chaired by Michael Gove. Those involved in Vote Leave have always strongly denied wrongdoing, insisting that Vote Leave and BeLeave were separate and that they acted in accordance with the rules. The government has now confirmed to Labour MP Bridget Phillipson in a parliamentary question that those criticised in its ongoing investigation have been given 28 days\u2019 warning of its findings. Rumours at Westminster suggest the report could be scheduled for publication on Wednesday - though the commission has not yet confirmed a date. Watson said: Each day the plot thickens about the murky dealings of the various Brexit campaigns. Now it seems senior figures at the heart of Number 10 who were involved in Vote Leave could have been informed about the contents of this important Electoral Commission investigation long before anyone else. If that\u2019s true, Number 10 would have had time to plan and even ensure key Brexit votes like the ones this week could happen before the investigation findings are published. You\u2019ve got to question whether that\u2019s appropriate and whether those people under investigation should really still be shaping and taking decisions at the heart of government. And here are more lines from Theresa May\u2019s article about Grenfell Tower in the Evening Standard. May admits that rehousing survivors of the fire has taken \u201ctoo long\u201d. But almost all families have now accepted an offer of accommodation, she says: It has taken too long, but of the 203 households in need of a new home, 198 households have now accepted an offer of accommodation, either permanent or temporary. She says the Grenfell inquiry must be given time to get to the truth of what happened. Given the scale of the tragedy, the public inquiry and police investigation will, inevitably, take time \u2014 longer than many of us would like. But while I will not tolerate unnecessary foot-dragging, they must be given the space they need to do their jobs properly. Only that way can any individuals and organisations found to be at fault be properly held to account for their actions. Only that way can justice be done. She says survivors, relatives and local residents will take the lead in deciding what happens to the Grenfell Tower site. A crucial part of the recovery process concerns the future of the tower and the site on which it sits. No decisions have yet been taken on this but I can again repeat my personal commitment that the bereaved, the survivors and the community will lead the process. She says the government is spending more than \u00a380m on the recovery effort. More than \u00a346m has been spent on the immediate response and recovery effort, with a further \u00a334m earmarked for the longer-term recovery; that\u2019s in addition to the almost \u00a325m donated by the public, nearly all of which has already been distributed to survivors and the bereaved. She says she will be planting camellia bushes in Downing Street to commemorate the victims. The group Grenfell United has come together to provide a voice for the survivors and they have done so with great dignity and determination. To honour that spirit they have invited communities and schools across the country to come together in a celebration of unity and diversity, turning next Friday into a national \u201cGreen for Grenfell Day\u201d. Head teachers are being encouraged to let children wear green to school and community groups will be out in force, helping others and fundraising for local charities. And, as night falls on Thursday, buildings across the country, including 10 Downing Street, will be illuminated in green \u2014 a very visible tribute to everyone affected by the fire. As part of Green for Grenfell, children from primary schools around the tower will visit No 10 tomorrow to plant two camellia bushes in the garden here. Camellias flower in the winter months, bringing life and colour to the darkest times of the year. Growing within sight of the cabinet room, they will provide a lasting reminder of those we lost on that darkest of nights. Last year, a week after the Grenfell Tower fire, Theresa May apologised for the way national and local government responded to the tragedy. One of the many things that angered survivors was the fact that May did not meet them on her first visit to the site of the fire. Today, in an article for the Evening Standard, May has gone much further in admitting that her own response was flawed. She says she will \u201calways\u201d regret giving the impression she did not care. Here is an extract from the article. It was a tragedy unparalleled in recent history and, although many people did incredible work during and after the fire, it has long been clear that the initial response was not good enough. I include myself in that. The day after the disaster I made the first of a number of trips to the site, thanking the firefighters for their work and holding a short meeting with the team in charge of the response. What I did not do on that first visit was meet the residents and survivors who had escaped the blaze. But the residents of Grenfell Tower needed to know that those in power recognised and understood their despair. And I will always regret that by not meeting them that day, it seemed as though I didn\u2019t care. That was never the case. And here is how the Standard are splashing on the story. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. The main line was Number 10 saying Theresa May expects President Trump to stand by the G7 communique which he agreed - before he subsequently disowned it after he lost his temper with the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Asked if May was disappointed by Trump\u2019s comments after he left Canada, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The communique was agreed by all the parties who attended the G7. We fully intend to honour it. We would hope that the US would similarly honour the commitments that they\u2019ve made. Here is the programme motion for the EU withdrawal bill debates on Tuesday and Wednesday. I\u2019m just off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am The Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp has more on the Davis/Barnier meeting. (See 9.43am.) Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP who was one of the 12 backbenchers who helped defeated the government on the EU withdrawal bill in December, told the Today programme this morning that she was \u201cminded\u201d to rebel on the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d amendment when it gets debated later this week. She also said that she and other Tory pro-Europeans wanted more concessions from the government on the customs union issue. She said: We would like to see further concessions on the amendment on the customs union because it is just a very sensible amendment that says keep it on the table, don\u2019t completely rule it out. But this insisted that this was not about bringing down the prime minister. She said: If it came back to us then having to have a vote of confidence, we would all vote to support the prime minister. We do support the prime minister. The Jacob Rees-Mogg LBC phone-in didn\u2019t really make news. What was most interesting was that, in the light of growing evidence of Brexiter despondency (see 9.03am), Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, was keen to urge his supporters to be \u201ccalm\u201d and \u201cpatient\u201d. Brexit was moving \u201cslowly in the right direction\u201d, he insisted. I think people should be calm. Inevitably in this negotiation and in this process people sometimes get frustrated, and the backstop deal is a problem. It depends what is in it, and it depends on the time limit. But what really matters is the withdrawal bill that is going through parliament this week and, very importantly, an article jointly authored by Amber Rudd and Iain Duncan Smith saying, basically, if you don\u2019t vote for this you risk getting Jeremy Corbyn and there are further discussions to have on how we leave, but this is just bringing in the decision to leave. And there\u2019s quite a degree of unity within the Conservative party at the moment. So I\u2019m optimistic about what\u2019s happening. I think it\u2019s going slowly in the right direction, more slowly than I would like, but still still in the right direction ... The key to this is that we shouldn\u2019t get over-exercised by negotiating documents when the other side hasn\u2019t even responded, because you have a great row about something and then the EU says, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter what that document says, we don\u2019t like it.\u2019 And we need to just be a little bit more patient as these negotiations go on. According to the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has had his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels. But Davis would not speak to the press afterwards, Crisp says. Q: Did you have any sympathy with Trump when you saw that picture of him being told off by Angela Merkel. Rees-Mogg says: I thought that picture was quite extraordinary. It showed the US being told off by less powerful nations. He says Trump won\u2019t have been bothered about being told off by Canada. He says he thinks it does not make sense to lecture Trump with \u201cthe usual liberal international platitudes\u201d. Q: Are any of your children addicted to computer games? Rees-Mogg says his children are aged from 10 to 11 months. He says some of his children ask to use the iPad in the morning. He lets them play with it for 30 minutes. And that\u2019s it. The phone-in was over. Q: What is the solution to the Irish border problem? Rees-Mogg says he agrees with Boris Johnson on this. This is a case of \u201cthe tail wagging the dog\u201d. He says the UK should leave it up to Ireland. If they want to put up a border, they can. But he guesses they won\u2019t. Q: Isn\u2019t it a good thing having EU immigrants who pay taxes? Rees-Mogg says you need the infrastructure in place to support them. Q: EU migrants are a great benefit to the economy? Rees-Mogg says immigration can benefit the economy. But the least helpful type of immigration is low-skills, low-wage immigration, of the kind we have had from the EU. Q: When will the government prepare for a backlog at Dover? Rees-Mogg says the government is making plans. He says there won\u2019t be a problem with incoming lorries. It is the UK\u2019s choice to decide what checks are imposed, and it will not impose checks. The problem will be with lorries going to France. But he says one third of those lorries are empty, because the UK imports more than it exports. If the French impose checks, there could be delays. But the Department for Transport has been plannning for this. It is one of the best departments are preparing for Brexit, he says. Q: There are already checks at Dover. Rees-Mogg says what he means was that there would be no extra checks. There will be no extra checks at first. The UK may decide to impose checks later. He says there may be a need for an Operation Stack in the short term. Q: Why short term? New controls could last forever. Rees-Mogg says it will be in everyone\u2019s interests to have a deal. He says sea travel costs are relatively low anyway. Q: What should happen to the Aquarius, the boat in the Mediterranean carrying migrants being refused entry to Italy? Rees-Mogg says the boat should go back to Libya. When European countries take in migrants coming in by boat, they encourage more people to make the journey, he says. Rees-Mogg says there won\u2019t be total unity in the Conservative party this week. He says someone like Ken Clarke will not change his views. Rees-Mogg says he respects that. But he says he thinks there will be enough unity this week to get the bill through, and to reinforce Theresa May\u2019s position. Q: And some Labour MPs might vote with you? Yes, says Rees-Mogg. He praises the Labour MP Caroline Flint for saying the referendum result must be respected. But he says saying this will probably not help her standing in her party. They are now taking the first question from a caller? Q: Shouldn\u2019t the people get a vote on the final deal? They have already had a vote on Brexit, he says. Q: But what about a vote on the final deal? Rees-Mogg says it is not clear what people would vote on. And he says there have been three votes already: a general election in 2015, with the Conservatives promising a referendum; the referendum; and the 2017 election. Q: Boris Johnson said last week that the government should employ Trump-style tactics in the Brexit talks. Rees-Mogg says Trump has turned out to be a surprisingly successful negotiator. There is something in the Trump style that is surprisingly successful. Q: So should May copy Trump? Rees-Mogg says people have to be authentic. May is not the same as Trump, he says. He says if May were to try to copy him, that might not be convincing, He says May will be in a stronger position when the EU withdrawal bill has passed. Q: Are you a fan of Trump? Rees-Mogg says he would not go that far. He thinks Trump is interesting. And it is important to have a good relationship with him. Nick Ferrari asks Jacob Rees-Mogg how Brexit supporters should react to last week\u2019s event. Rees-Mogg says people should stay calm. He says the backstop is a problem. But the focus now is on the EU withdrawal bill. He endorses what Iain Duncan Smith and Amber Rudd said in their joint article yesterday. Q: Do we need a backstop? Rees-Mogg says he does not think it is necessary. And it is only a backstop. And you should not get over-exercised about something that might be rejected by the other side, he says. He also urges people to be patient. Brexiters are increasingly gloomy about the prospects for the project this country has been embarking since they successfully won the campaign to leave the EU two years ago this month. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, told a Tory dinner recently that Brexit could lead to a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and that the UK could end up with \u201cthe worst of both worlds\u201d. Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP and one of people credited with making Brexit happen, wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph (paywall) yesterday saying: \u201cWe are dangerously close to an outcome that is worse than either staying or leaving.\u201d And at the weekend Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, told the Today programme that, if Theresa May remained prime minister, the UK could finish up after Brexit \u201cperhaps in an even worse place than we are now\u201d. What does Jacob Rees-Mogg, the most influential Conservative Brexiter on the backbenches and party members\u2019 favourite for next leader, think? We\u2019re about to find out. He is just staring his LBC phone-in. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, hosts his LBC phone-in. 9.45m: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minster, launches Scotland\u2019s national performance framework. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 3.30pm: Theresa May is expected to give a statement to MPs on the G7 summit. 6pm: May addresses the Conservative backbench 1922 committee. And, at some point today, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is meeting Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019 top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

In the 19th century we didn\u2019t much like the loud annexationist voices south of the border, or American support for Sinn F\u00e9in adventurers who thought by seizing the Canadian colonies they could force Britain out of Ireland. More recently our relations during the Vietnam war were strained because many Canadians opposed it, and said so, and Canada sheltered draft dodgers.

For generations, Canadians have moved south in search of jobs, education and fame. A large part of Canada heads for Florida, California and Hawaii in the winter to get away from the snow. When the US endures disasters we sympathize. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11 Canadians opened their airfields and homes to the thousands of American planes and travellers who were stranded here.

Our founding principle was not life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness but peace, order and good government. </p> <p>We have nevertheless worked hard to nurture the relationship with the US. Canadians have always known far more about the Americans than vice versa \u2013 which is why, among other things, we have tended to do well in trade negotiations and disputes.

          "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Britain has been hit by a flurry of weak economic data, that undermines confidence that its economy is recovering from its winter slowdown. New figures show that: UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in March, the worst performance since 2012 The trade gap widened to a 19-month high, at \u00a35.3bn Construction output posted another quarter-on-quarter decline. Economists warned that Brexit uncertainty may now be biting, making it harder for UK firms to win new business abroad. The drop in manufacturing output was driven by weaker demand for steel and electrical machinery. My colleague Larry Elliott says the figures are troubling: The manufacturing figures from the Office for National Statistics are troubling for three reasons. First, surveys had suggested a much better performance. Second, the 0.5% drop in production in the three months ending in April makes forecasts of a strong bounce-back from tepid growth in early 2018 look premature. Third, even if signs are correct that consumer spending is picking up because of falling inflation, the UK will have reverted to its old pattern of growth after a short interlude in which activity was better balanced. The markets have shrugged off last weekend\u2019s fractious and unconstructive G7 meeting, which saw Donald Trump fall out spectacularly with Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau in a post-meeting tweet storm. Trump has now declared that trade should be truly reciprocal, as he continues to criticise other nations for their tariffs even as he threatens more of his own. European stock markets are all up in late trading, led by Italian optimism that its new government will not consider leaving the eurozone. FTSE 100: Up 50 points or 0.66% at 7731 points German DAX: Up 53 points or 0.4% at 12,819 points French CAC: Up 23 points or 0.4% at 5,473 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: Up 738 points or 3.4% at 22,094 European car companies have taken a hit, though, due to fears they could be hit by new US tariffs. And it\u2019s been another rough day for the UK retail sector, with discount chain Poundworld falling into administration. More than 5,000 jobs are on the line. That\u2019s probably all for today, thanks for reading and commenting. GW Shares in European carmakers have fallen today, amid concerns that they could be dragged into a trade war between the US and Europe. Over the weekend, Donald Trump suggested he could impose tariffs on auto imports, using the same \u2018national security\u2019 argument he\u2019s already used for steel. Trump told reporters that there\u2019s an economic justification for tariffs: \u201cIt\u2019s economic. It\u2019s the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet.\u201d Any new tariffs could make it uncompetitive for European carmakers to sell cars in the US, which explains why shares are under pressure today: However, several European carmakers including Fiat Chrysler and BMW actually have factories in America, building cars for export. New tariffs could encourage manufacturers to make more cars in the US, or it could force them to move production to cheaper sites. Greece has won more plaudits today as Athens\u2019 leftist-led government unveiled a multi-bill of \u201curgent\u201d reforms before the Greek parliament. The move officially launches the countdown to bailout exit in August, Helena Smith reports from Athens. As Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Giorgos Chouliarakis formally presented the reforms before MPs - saying their passage would finally permit the country to exit international bailout oversight and successfully complete talks on the key issue of debt relief \u2013 Athens received what amounted to some of the highest praise, yet, from the euro group chairman himself. After almost a decade of being dependent on international bailout funds, Greece was ready to stand on its feet again, said Mario Centeno, president of the group of euro area finance ministers. \u201cGreece is a different country today,\u201d the Portuguese finance minister told a conference in Lisbon. \u201cGreece has the conditions to take on its own hands the process of its economic and social development, within the euro framework, and can always count on European solidarity if it sticks to the path of internal responsibility.\u201d The high praise came as Chouliarakis said it was vital the draft bill outlining further pension cuts, labour market reforms and privatisations in the energy domain, was voted on this week so that Greece could complete its final review by creditors in time for the next euro group meeting on June 21. That is when Athens not only hopes to take stock of a new \u20ac12b aid disbursement \u2013 it\u2019s last as a bailout programme recipient \u2013 but could finally embark on meaningful debt relief talks, he said. Greece\u2019s \u20ac320bn debt mountain is by far the biggest in Europe making economic recovery impossible if it is not reduced. Chouliarakis told MPs: \u201cCompletion of the fourth and last review of the economic adjustment programme will permit the Euro group on the 21 June to discuss, conclude and decide on a packet of measures for the reduction of Greek debt. Consequently it should be obvious to all why the legislation is of urgent character.\u201d Greece\u2019s staggering debt pile will also be the focus of talks today between German chancellor Angela Merkel and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde today. Ding ding! Wall Street has opened calmly, as US traders take the G7 meeting in their stride. The Dow Jones industrial average is 22 points higher, or 0.1%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also in the green (just). Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA says investors aren\u2019t surprised that Donald Trump fell out (badly) with other world leaders in Quebec. The mood in financial markets is relatively upbeat at the start of a very busy week, as investors shrug off the G7 meeting which didn\u2019t exactly go to plan as Donald Trump rejected the prepared communique and left early. While everyone will have hoped for a better outcome from the meeting, I don\u2019t think anyone is surprised given Trump\u2019s views on trade and his combative approach to the country\u2019s allies on the issue. Perhaps it was the expectation that this was a likely outcome that has led to investors shrugging it off and turning their attention to something more interesting, and there\u2019s certainly plenty for them to focus on in the coming days. Newsflash: Jaguar Land Rover is moving the production of its Land Rover Discovery SUV vehicle to Slovakia, from Solihull in the UK. JLR says it will retool its Solihull plant to handle a new generation of electric, petrol and diesel models. But there could still be job cuts at the plant, close to Birmingham in the Midlands, as the changes are made. Kaye Wiggins of Bloomberg has more details: Discovery production will be moved from the beginning of 2019, meaning job cuts at the Solihull plant are possible before it ramps up staffing again, the people said. The investment, totaling hundreds of millions of pounds, according to the people, could cut both ways. While some agency-employed plant workers may lose their jobs, the decision to build electric cars at Solihull marks a major commitment to U.K. manufacturing amid uncertainty over Brexit. European stock markets are holding onto this morning\u2019s gains, as traders scamper from their desks for a quick lunchbreak (or spill sandwich crumbs on their keyboards). The European-wide Stoxx 600 is up 0.4%, thanks to rallies in London and in Italy. Italian stocks are buoyant after finance minister Giovanni Tria has insisted that Italy remained committed to the euro. Investors are putting the G7 meeting behind them, and concentrating on the imminent Trump-Kim summit in Singapore. Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, says. \u201cThe FTSE has made a strong start for the week, with bullishness back in vogue in spite of a geopolitical dust-up at the weekend\u2019s G7 Summit in Canada. Investors appear to be writing off President Trump\u2019s bickering with his colleagues as same old, same old (start in attack dog mode, dial back rhetoric later), perhaps more interested in the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. UK building firms are suffering from Brexit uncertainty and the weakness of the UK pound, says Michael Thirkettle, chief executive of construction consulting and design agency McBains. As mentioned earlier, construction output shrank by 3,4% in the three months to April. Almost every part of the sector suffered: Today\u2019s figures also show that total construction new orders fell by 4.6% in the first three months of this year, which will drag on output in the coming months. Thirkettle says: \u201cToday\u2019s statistics prove the construction sector is still in troubled waters with continuing uncertainties, borne from Brexit, and the poor value of sterling impacting on the cost of imported materials, meaning many UK companies are delaying investment decisions. \u201cThe real test, however, will be in the months to come, given the uncertainty over issues like Brexit that have impacted on UK companies\u2019 commitment to new projects over the last two years.\u201d Yet more disappointing news: the UK economy only grew by 0.2% in the last three months, from March to May. That\u2019s according to the latest estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). It\u2019s better than the 0.1% recorded in the first three months, but it dashes hopes of a healthy rebound from the winter slowdown. Economists had pencilled in growth of 0.3%. Amit Kara, NIESR\u2019s head of UK macroeconomic forecasting, says the UK is only growing half as fast as its potential growth rate, partly due to the snow in March. Economic growth has slowed materially since the start of this year and it continues to remain weak. One reason for sluggish growth is the disruption caused by severe weather in March, particularly to the construction sector. The latest data also shows a notable slowdown in manufacturing sector output that appears to be driven by both domestic and external conditions. By contrast, the retail sector and the dominant services sector may be recovering. At Poundworld in Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, shoppers were dismayed to hear of the chain\u2019s demise, reports my colleague Helen Pidd. \u201cOh what a shame,\u201d said Sylvia Andrew, 61, who had just paid a pound for a dummy security camera to protect her hen house. \u201cIf someone comes to nick my chickens they\u2019re not to know it\u2019s not real. If you put two AA batteries in a light flashes.\u201d. Currently signed off sick, she counts every penny, explaining: \u201cAt Poundworld you get two Pears soaps for \u00a31. It\u2019s \u00a31.50 at the supermarket.\u201d Joanne Betts, 48, a carer, had just bought four packets of Glow sticks for \u00a31 each and some bin bags. She told us: \u201cI didn\u2019t think a place like this would close. I\u2019 m in every week buying things I don\u2019t need.\u201d Inside, shoppers could spend a pound on anything from flip-flops to rat poison or packets of Aunt Bessie\u2019s yorkshire pudding mix. One of Poundworld\u2019s problems may have been its competitors. Next door to its Hyde store is Bodyworks, a discount cosmetic outlet. Next to that is B&amp;M Bargains, a northern chain which recently announced plans to open 45 stores down south. Add to that the Quality Save in the precinct, the Iceland in the shopping centre carpark and a branch of Yorkshire frozen food retailer Jack Fulton and it\u2019s clear bargain hunters are spoiled for choice. The slide in the pound today is pushing shares higher in London (as a weaker currency is good for exporters). The FTSE 100 is now up 70 points today at 7750, as City traders continue to shrug off the G7 mess. Newsflash: UK discount chain Poundworld has gone into administration, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. This is the latest in a string of retail failures this year, following the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin. My colleague Rob Davies explains how last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm failed: Poundworld, which has a chain of 335 shops, filed a notice of intention to appoint an administrator last Thursday, giving it temporary protection from its creditors. But plans to find a buyer for the business have now been abandoned, although the administrators are likely to seek buyers for parcels of stores. But two potential rescue buyouts have fallen through, with private equity firms Rcapital and Alteri Partners both walking away after talks with current owners TPG Capital. All this weak economic data is bad for the pound. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.335. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro, to \u20ac1.134. The 1.4% tumble in UK manufacturing output in April has come as a nasty shock to economists, who had expected a small rise. It undermines hopes that the UK economy was bouncing back from its slowdown last winter. Brexit could be partly responsible for the drop in UK manufacturing output last month. Economics journalist Dharshini Davis suspects that firms may find it harder to win business, because of the uncertainty over trading relations after March 2019. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), fears that trade war fears are already hurting UK exporters. Here\u2019s his take on Britain\u2019s widening trade gap: \u201cThe deterioration in the UK\u2019s trade position in April is a concern and means that the UK\u2019s trade deficit remains significantly higher than the historical average. This deterioration largely reflects a marked decline in exports in the month. It is possible that the UK is now moving past the recent sweet spot for exporters, with growth in key markets moderating and the impact of the post-EU referendum slump in sterling, which has helped some exporters, subsiding. The possibility of an escalating trade war has added to the downside risks for exporters. \u201cMore must be done to support UK exporters by addressing longstanding issues, from the lack of practical support for exporters to chronic skills shortages.\u201d And Donald Trump thinks he\u2019s got trade problems.... This morning\u2019s economic data paints a rather grim picture of the UK economy. Here\u2019s the ONS\u2019s head of national accounts, Rob Kent-Smith: \u201cManufacturing fell in the three months to April with electrical machinery and steel for infrastructure projects seeing reduced production. International demand continued to slow and the domestic market remained subdued. However, oil and gas production grew strongly in the aftermath of the Forties pipeline closure at the end of last year. \u201cWhile construction output saw a small bounceback in April after a poor start to the year, over the longer-term this sector continues to contract with significant falls across most types of work. \u201cConstruction orders fell for a second successive quarter after recent boosts from large rail projects. However, new housing orders reached their highest level since before the economic downturn. \u201cThe trade deficit widened as exports fell by more than imports, with exports of goods and services both declining. Exports of machinery, aircraft and pharmaceuticals all saw notable falls.\u201d Make that a triple-dose of bad news! UK construction output fell by 3.3% year-on-year in April. That\u2019s the fourth drop in a row, and the longest negative run since May 2013. In a double-dose of bad news, Britain\u2019s trade gap with the rest of the world has worsened. The total UK trade deficit widened by \u00a31.9bn to \u00a39.7bn in the three months to April 2018, due mainly to falling exports of both goods and services. Here\u2019s the details: Goods exports fell \u00a33.1 billion, due mainly to falls in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft, while services exports also fell \u00a32.5 billion in the three months to April 2018. Falling volumes was the main reason for the declines in exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft in the three months to April 2018 as price movements were relatively small. The UK\u2019s trade in goods deficit improved \u00a30.6 billion with countries outside of the EU and worsened \u00a31.2 billion with countries inside the EU in the three months to April 2018. In April alone, the trade gap widened to nearly \u00a35.3bn. Britain ran a surplus of \u00a38.7bn on services, but that was more than wiped out by a \u00a314bn deficit in goods. Total industrial production in the UK fell by 0.8% last month, dragged down by that worrying 1.4% slide in manufacturing. Energy production fell by 2%, thanks to the warmer weather. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s manufacturers have suffered their biggest monthly fall in over five years -- raising new worries about the strength of the economy. UK manufacturing output fell by 1.4% in April 2018, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u2019s the biggest monthly fall since October 2012, when it shrank by 1.8%. The ONE warns: There is widespread weakness with 9 of the 13 sub-sectors decreasing and this is a continuation of the recent slowdown in this sector. Over the last three months, manufacturing output has now fallen by 0.5% - the worst performance since May 2017. The ONS blames \u201cdecreases in electrical equipment (9.4%), and basic metals and metal products (1.8%).\u201d More to follow.... Donald Trump told fellow G7 members that America was tired of other countries imposing unfair tariffs. The data, though, don\u2019t back this up. According to the World Bank, the average tariff on goods traded between countries has now fallen to 2.9%, thanks to various trade deals. G7 countries actually have lower tariffs -- at just 1.6% for goods coming into the UK, France, Germany or the US. Of course, there are still significant tariffs on some goods - such as milk imports into China, or tobacco imports into the US. But by unilaterally slapping tariffs on steel imports, Trump risks driving up the global tariff burden. Germany\u2019s economy minister has said the G7 meeting has bolstered unity among European Union members. Peter Altmaier told reports in Brussels that: \u201cThe commotion at the G7 summit in Canada has brought the European Union closer together. It is important we show unity at all levels.\u201d Four EU members took part in the G7 meeting - Germany, France, Italy and the UK. Like Canada, the EU is expected to hit back at America with a range of retaliatory tariffs on July 1st, in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Chancellor Angela Merkel took an unusually blunt line, saying that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the G7 communique by tweet was sobering and depressing. She told the ARD broadcaster that: \u201cWe won\u2019t allow ourselves be ripped off again and again. We will act too. The Canadian dollar is dropping this morning, in the face of deteriorating relations between Washington and Ottawa. The loonie (as it\u2019s known in financial circles) has shed 0.3% against the greenback to C$1.296. That\u2019s a modest fall, following Trump\u2019s claim that Canadian PM Trudeau was \u201cvery dishonest and weak.\u201d Trump is particularly angry about Canadian milk, where domestic subsidies and high tariffs protect Canada\u2019s farmers from the vicissitudes of the dairy market. But that centralised \u2018supply management\u2019 system does seem to work; it avoids both bankruptcies and gluts by guaranteeing farmers a decent price. Trudeau is determined to support it. Ding! European stock markets are open, and rallying despite the lack of progress at the G7 meeting. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 35 points, or almost 0.5%, with similar gains in Frankfurt and Paris. Spain\u2019s IBEX has jumped by over 1%. Traders are jittery about the acrimony seen in Canada last weekend, says Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, but also hopeful of progress in Singapore. Van Dulken explains: Thankfully, there is more optimism about the US President\u2019s meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Potential for a meaningful discussions about de-nuclearisation on the Korean peninsula could diffuse some of the tensions between US and North Korea, improve the global mood and gain Trump some brownie points after this weekend\u2019s events at the G7. South Korea\u2019s stock market has led the rally in Asia today, on hopes that Donald Trump\u2019s next summit will be more productive than his last one. The Kospi index has gained 0.75% as traders prepared for the historic Trump-Kim meeting tomorrow. There are also gains in Japan and India, although China\u2019s benchmark index has dropped into the red. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are hoping for a breakthrough: The US President left the G7 summit early in order to prepare for his meeting with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader. The meeting will take place today in Singapore. There has been a bit of toing and froing about the meeting, but now it seems as if it is finally going ahead. Last summer there were some volatile sessions on global stock markets on account of the heightened tensions between the US and North Korea because of the regime\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. The meeting between the two leaders could greatly improve political relations around the world. President Trump has launched another tirade at the rest of the G7, as he prepared for his summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un in Singapore on Tuesday: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was a bad weekend for fans of the rules-based international order, as the meeting of top world leaders struggled to meet even the lowest expectations. Relations between America and the rest of the G7 look worse than ever, after Donald Trump left the meeting early, refused to sign the official communique, and accused his host Justin Trudeau of making \u2018false statements\u2019. Getting all the adults in one room is meant to deliver progress and resolve differences, but not this time. Instead, the G7 has taken another step backwards, with Trump accusing the rest of the world of treating America like a \u2018Piggy Bank\u2019. So, the US is sticking to its new tariffs on steel and aluminium, and Canada is vowing to hit back with its retaliatory tariffs on US goods from July 1 \u2013 despite being accused of treachery by Trump\u2019s economic advisor. The scale of the debacle suggests that the alliances and structures build up over the last 70 years are now creaking alarmingly, raising the dangers of a full-blown trade war. The financial markets, though, are remarkably unconcerned by events in Quebec. Asian stocks have risen overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 0.5%. European markets are expected to rally too; Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is expected to creep higher today too. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says investors are shrugging off the G7 \u201cMarkets appear able to shake off geopolitical risks with stocks showing firmness in the face of a pretty torrid weekend for free trade. Asian shares have risen and futures point to the FTSE opening up around 0.2%, with smaller rises for the DAX and CAC. After a stormy G7 meeting, the US seems to have turned its back on its allies and is prepared to ratchet up the pressure on trade. Ostensibly this should not be good for risk, though markets appear deaf at present to such rumbings. This is brinkmanship that may ultimately end up working to the advantage of the US; but it is also likely to depress investor sentiment, and therefore growth through the second part of 2018. Nevertheless, expectations coming into the event were exceptionally low and so there has been little negative reaction in the markets so far. On the economics front, we get new UK industrial production and trade figures today - plus a new estimate of how the British economy fared in the last three months.

There\u2019s so much in this image it\u2019s difficult to know where to begin. Donald Trump, as well as Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe, cross their arms. Therapists often tell you this is very defensive body language, but actually most of the time I think people are just cold. In Trump\u2019s case, though, it definitely is defensiveness, because he is always defensive, because he is as thin-skinned as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle\">fontanelle</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s John Bolton, the national security adviser and a man who looks so much like the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/seuss/images/7/75/Lorax.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171018170527\">Lorax</a> from the Dr Seuss books that it continues to amaze me that: a) people don\u2019t point this out on a daily basis, and b) that a copyright infringement hasn\u2019t been filed.</p> <p>Theresa May, unsurprisingly given the state of Brexit negotiations, is barely in the frame.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/g7-in-disarray-after-trump-rejects-communique-and-attacks-weak-trudeau\">G7 communique</a> wasn\u2019t a successful show, however, given that Trump reneged on the whole thing via tweet (of course) soon after leaving. And then accused Justin Trudeau of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/10/justin-trudeau-donald-trump-tariffs-g7-north-korea-summit\">stabbing him in the back</a>\u201d, which would have been difficult, given that Trump was sitting down for the entire thing. Interestingly, Merkel is almost completely obscured in this version, which makes sense vis-a-vis Macron jostling for lead position on the European stage. Brigitte\u2019s probably at home sending him an email to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/29/michael-goves-wife-doubts-boris-johnson-email-sarah-vine-dacre-murdoch\">be your stubborn best</a>\u201d. But we all know Merkel\u2019s where it\u2019s at.</p> <h2>Donald Trump\u2019s photo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Scavino45/status/1005464870551150592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A look at negotiations, from behind the scenes at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/G7Charlevoix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#G7Charlevoix</a> Summit. <a href=\"https://t.co/2LdJAgt6fE\">pic.twitter.com/2LdJAgt6fE</a></p>&mdash; Dan Scavino Jr. (@Scavino45) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Scavino45/status/1005464870551150592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 9, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Trump is so stupid that the image he released could not show him in a worse light. In fact it barely shows him in any light. Encircled by the other leaders and aides, known as sherpas, Trump couldn\u2019t look more cornered and out of his depth. Half of the circle are openly laughing \u2013 look at Trudeau; the man to his left; and the woman in blue, for instance, while the others are throwing such intense side-eye they might as well be hammerhead sharks. It almost looks as if he is sinking into an abyss, but it\u2019s not wise to vocalise one\u2019s wishes in case they don\u2019t come true.</p> <h2>Justin Trudeau\u2019s photo<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2703d4e31dc48f031cdae4799ad2f64afda1c26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2703d4e31dc48f031cdae4799ad2f64afda1c26/0_14_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau with G7 leaders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo of Justin Trudeau and G7 leaders <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamScotti/status/1005512215816962048\">tweeted by</a> his official photographer Adam Scotti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Scotti/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Naturally, in Trudeau\u2019s official photographer\u2019s pic, he looks like a fit Jesus, preaching to his disciples.

He looks impressive, of course, with his tousled hair and cheekbones \u2013 even though there is apparently a global conspiracy to never mention the fact he awkwardly talks out of the side of his mouth.</p> <p>What\u2019s great about this particular picture is that John Bolton has clean lost interest and is now reading a book. The Lorax, obviously. (Even though that book was a tale of environmentalism and the Trump administration is intent on destroying the entire planet.)</p> <p>Merkel, too, seems to have checked out in this photo, pondering what to have for tea later, while Trump looks like someone\u2019s who been sitting at home waiting for a washing machine to arrive for the past four hours, despite the courier texting it\u2019d come between 9-10am.</p> <p>Macron appears to be talking across Theresa May which, once again: Brexit.</p> <h2>Giuseppe Conte\u2019s photo</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GiuseppeConteIT/status/1005494531024797697\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"it\" dir=\"ltr\">Seconda giornata qui al <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/G7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#G7</a> in Canada dove sto continuando a lavorare per rappresentare e difendere gli interessi degli italiani.

The resolution is so poor it looks as though it\u2019s been taken with a Motorola Razr, circa 2007. The only things that draw the eye are the ubiquitous box-jackets of Merkel and May, a sartorial affliction that affects female politicians worldwide, as though they don\u2019t believe they\u2019re allowed to have a waist.

          "bodyText": "They say a picture is worth a thousand words \u2013 which, obviously, as a writer, I am going to disagree with. No butcher is going to extol the virtues of a veggie burger, after all. But some photographs are pretty special. Take the photo Angela Merkel released of the G7 leaders\u2019 meeting this past weekend. It has been compared online to a Renaissance painting, which begs the question whether anybody on Twitter has actually seen any Renaissance art. It more recalls a stock photo with the file name \u201cAGMtenseboardroom.jpg\u201d. But, rather brilliantly, each leader\u2019s office released photographs literally from different angles \u2013 there\u2019s an AS-level government and politics answer that\u2019s writing itself \u2013 with the following results. Let\u2019s break them all down. Angela Merkel\u2019s photo The original. There\u2019s so much in this image it\u2019s difficult to know where to begin. Donald Trump, as well as Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe, cross their arms. Therapists often tell you this is very defensive body language, but actually most of the time I think people are just cold. In Trump\u2019s case, though, it definitely is defensiveness, because he is always defensive, because he is as thin-skinned as a fontanelle. There\u2019s John Bolton, the national security adviser and a man who looks so much like the Lorax from the Dr Seuss books that it continues to amaze me that: a) people don\u2019t point this out on a daily basis, and b) that a copyright infringement hasn\u2019t been filed. Theresa May, unsurprisingly given the state of Brexit negotiations, is barely in the frame. We\u2019ve screwed it, lads. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s photo Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort is a weird one, because it looks like the backstage photo pop stars take at gigs where they all say grace together and hope for a successful show. The G7 communique wasn\u2019t a successful show, however, given that Trump reneged on the whole thing via tweet (of course) soon after leaving. And then accused Justin Trudeau of \u201cstabbing him in the back\u201d, which would have been difficult, given that Trump was sitting down for the entire thing. Interestingly, Merkel is almost completely obscured in this version, which makes sense vis-a-vis Macron jostling for lead position on the European stage. Brigitte\u2019s probably at home sending him an email to \u201cbe your stubborn best\u201d. But we all know Merkel\u2019s where it\u2019s at. Donald Trump\u2019s photo Trump is so stupid that the image he released could not show him in a worse light. In fact it barely shows him in any light. Encircled by the other leaders and aides, known as sherpas, Trump couldn\u2019t look more cornered and out of his depth. Half of the circle are openly laughing \u2013 look at Trudeau; the man to his left; and the woman in blue, for instance, while the others are throwing such intense side-eye they might as well be hammerhead sharks. It almost looks as if he is sinking into an abyss, but it\u2019s not wise to vocalise one\u2019s wishes in case they don\u2019t come true. Justin Trudeau\u2019s photo Naturally, in Trudeau\u2019s official photographer\u2019s pic, he looks like a fit Jesus, preaching to his disciples. He\u2019s so chivalrous he has even pulled a chair out for someone who doesn\u2019t exist. He looks impressive, of course, with his tousled hair and cheekbones \u2013 even though there is apparently a global conspiracy to never mention the fact he awkwardly talks out of the side of his mouth. What\u2019s great about this particular picture is that John Bolton has clean lost interest and is now reading a book. The Lorax, obviously. (Even though that book was a tale of environmentalism and the Trump administration is intent on destroying the entire planet.) Merkel, too, seems to have checked out in this photo, pondering what to have for tea later, while Trump looks like someone\u2019s who been sitting at home waiting for a washing machine to arrive for the past four hours, despite the courier texting it\u2019d come between 9-10am. Macron appears to be talking across Theresa May which, once again: Brexit. Giuseppe Conte\u2019s photo Giuseppe Conte is the newbie of the group, having only been sworn in as Italy\u2019s prime minister at the beginning of the month. And even then he was a compromise candidate, suspected to have embellished his CV (but haven\u2019t we all made mistakes, eh Paul Nuttall?). This photo is shambolic \u2013 like, one might say, the new Italian government. The resolution is so poor it looks as though it\u2019s been taken with a Motorola Razr, circa 2007. The only things that draw the eye are the ubiquitous box-jackets of Merkel and May, a sartorial affliction that affects female politicians worldwide, as though they don\u2019t believe they\u2019re allowed to have a waist. If male politicians can wear the same thing every single day, women politicians should be able to wear a slimline blazer. Shinzo Abe\u2019s photo Finally, we come to Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s photographic vibe. To Abe\u2019s left is Yasutoshi Nishimura, the deputy chief cabinet secretary. He is clutching his pass as though nobody would know who he was otherwise. As if he doesn\u2019t have the same status as Bolton\u2019s moustache, which should have its own pass, quite frankly. Maybe a dressing room. A rider. I absolutely cannot wait for the Kim Jong-un and Trump summit photos. Hannah Jane Parkinson writes on pop culture, music, tech, football, politics and mental health",

          "bodyText": "Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser said the US pulled out of a G7 communique because the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, \u201cstabbed us in the back\u201d and accused the leader of one America\u2019s most important allies of playing a \u201csophomoric political stunt for domestic consumption\u201d. In an extraordinary interview with CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Larry Kudlow, who was present for negotiations at the G7 summit in Quebec over the weekend, said Trudeau had instigated \u201ca betrayal\u201d and was \u201cessentially double-crossing President Trump\u201d. Trudeau used a media conference on Saturday to reject a US demand for a sunset clause in the North American trade agreement, Nafta, that Trump has at different times pressed to abolish or renegotiate. The prime minister also said Canada would \u201cmove forward with retaliatory measures\u201d in response to the Trump administration\u2019s move to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel imports from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. The move enraged Trump, who branded his Canadian counterpart \u201cdishonest and weak\u201d in a furious tweet, announcing the US would pull out of an agreed communique. The G7 communique said the leaders of seven of the most powerful countries in the world agreed on the need for \u201cfree, fair and mutually beneficial trade\u201d and the importance of fighting protectionism. Kudlow added that Trump had made the decision to pull out of the agreement in an attempt to save face ahead of his historic summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore. \u201cPotus [the president of the United States] is not going to let a Canadian prime minister push him around \u2013 push him, Potus around, on the eve of this,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cHe is not going to permit any show of weakness on the trip to negotiate with North Korea. Nor should he.\u201d Trump continued the onslaught against Trudeau on Monday, tweeting from Singapore. Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared on Fox News Sunday and said Trudeau deserved \u201ca special place in hell\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door, and that\u2019s what Bad Faith Justin Trudeau did with that stunt press conference,\u201d Navarro said, adding that his comments had come \u201cright from Air Force One\u201d. Kudlow, a staunch conservative who regularly pounded his fists on the desk throughout his interview on CNN, argued that Trudeau\u2019s comments were \u201ca great disservice to the whole G7\u201d. A representative of Trudeau did not respond to a request for comment but Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters in Quebec City: \u201cCanada does not conduct its diplomacy through ad hominem attacks \u2026 and we refrain particularly from ad hominem attacks when it comes from a close ally.\u201d Leaders of other G7 member states hit back at the Trump administration\u2019s decision to pull out of the joint statement. The office of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, issued a statement saying cooperation on the international stage \u201ccannot be dictated by fits of anger and throwaway remarks\u201d. The statement continued: \u201cWe spend two days working out a [joint] statement and commitments.

But a day after Trump left a trail of diplomatic chaos from Canada to Singapore, the site of his summit with Kim Jong-un of North Korea, a picture of world leaders apparently confronting Trump dominated reactions to the G7 summit. The picture was taken by Jesco Denzel, a German government photographer, and released by Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It shows Trump, arms folded and eyes glaring, sitting while around him stand a group of world leaders and their advisers. Merkel is centre stage, arms planted on a table, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, standing to her left, arms folded and a look of resignation on his face. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, stands next to Merkel, partially obscured, with the British prime minister, Theresa May, more obscured still at his right. To many observers the photograph, a rare glimpse of diplomatic activity not wreathed in smiles and handshakes, seemed both a summation of the effect of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy and the perfect pictorial accompaniment to a tense couple of days in Canada.

The EU has announced $3.3bn in retaliatory tariffs on US imports to take effect next month, and Mexico and Canada have levied similar penalties, raising the specter of a trade war. Even a White House economic analysis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/us/politics/white-house-tariffs-growth.html\">reportedly found</a> that Trump\u2019s tariffs would hurt US economic growth. </p> <p>For Coatesville and places like it, however, there are more pressing problems than the threat of a trade war. Since the decline of big steel in the 1970s and 1980s, the town of about 13,000 people has faced a flat jobs market, shrinking property values and stagnant income levels. Main street is a mix of vacant storefronts and a shuttered barbershop, secondhand stores and a Budget Fuel gas station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82e407fde381290acb467dbed89e92089d3538e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82e407fde381290acb467dbed89e92089d3538e4/0_47_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"COATESVILLE, PA - June 6, 2018: A bow tied recliner is displayed for sale on Main Street in Coatesville, PA, the location of the Lukens Steel Mill, the oldest steel mill in commission within the United States, on June 6, 2018.

The plant\u2019s standard products are plates of 160 inches and 206in wide, up to 19ins thick, cut to length.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the advantages that Coatesville has is the fact that it makes armor plate, which is utilized by the military.

Theresa May called the tariffs \u201cunjustified and deeply disappointing\u201d in a phone call with Trump last week, Downing Street said. Canada, Europe and Mexico have announced retaliatory levies. But in places like Coatesville \u2013 and elsewhere across the United States where there have been green shoots of activity in the domestic steel industry in recent months \u2013 Trump\u2019s tariffs are being welcomed as a long-overdue boost that just might put US steel back on its feet. Vonie Long, a maintenance tech electrician in the Coatesville plant and the president of the local steelworkers\u2019 union, estimated that about half his colleagues opposed Trump for president and half supported him \u2013 a split reflecting regional voting patterns. But even workers who don\u2019t like Trump approve of the tariffs, said Long, 51. \u201cOverall we\u2019re optimistic that this is going to help us here in Coatesville and as US steelworkers,\u201d he said. \u201cTariffs on steel are a new ballgame for us. A lot of co-workers are optimistic that it will level the playing field for us.\u201d Russ Huggins Jr, 53, is a mill truck driver at the plant with 32 years\u2019 experience. He said he voted for Trump and watched many of his Democratic colleagues cross party lines to do the same. \u201cNobody helped the steel industry, we were just getting the shaft,\u201d said Huggins. \u201cAnd so I think that\u2019s a lot of the reason why a lot of the people changed over and did support Trump. I think it\u2019s high time that somebody starts really doing something for the steel industry instead of just talking about it.\u201d Tom Handley is a maintenance tech millwright at the plant with 12 years\u2019 experience. \u201cIt probably might start some crap other places, but for steel it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Handley said of the tariffs. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for us.\u201d Employment in the US steel industry has dropped by 35% since 1998, and the United States imports nearly four times as much steel as it exports, according to commerce department figures. The Trump administration has declared a goal for the US steel industry to climb to 80% production capacity, up from its current 73%. But economists warn that steel tariffs could hurt the US economy, raise prices and harm American workers, including steelworkers. The EU has announced $3.3bn in retaliatory tariffs on US imports to take effect next month, and Mexico and Canada have levied similar penalties, raising the specter of a trade war. Even a White House economic analysis reportedly found that Trump\u2019s tariffs would hurt US economic growth. For Coatesville and places like it, however, there are more pressing problems than the threat of a trade war. Since the decline of big steel in the 1970s and 1980s, the town of about 13,000 people has faced a flat jobs market, shrinking property values and stagnant income levels. Main street is a mix of vacant storefronts and a shuttered barbershop, secondhand stores and a Budget Fuel gas station. \u201cSteelmaking has been part of Coatesville for 200 years,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \u201cThe steel mill used to employ more than 5,000 people, so clearly the role in the local economy is somewhat diminished, but it\u2019s still critically important. \u201cFor people in the area who don\u2019t want or need a four-year college degree, it\u2019s one of the few paths that remain to the middle class. It\u2019s a vital part of that economy that\u2019s irreplaceable.\u201d The Coatesville mill might have been closed completely, locals say, were it not for the intervention of the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who led a group that bought the plant in 2003 and later sold it to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal. \u201cA majority of my co-workers, they look at Wilbur Ross as somebody that lifted us up out of the ash,\u201d said Long, the union president. Ross once again has a key role in Coatesville, as the current commerce secretary and architect of the new tariffs. Ross, whose former firm made a big investment in Chinese steel shortly after he joined the cabinet, declared in a January report arguing for the tariffs that \u201cdomestic steel production is essential for national security\u201d. While Ross was said to have divested his steel holdings to join the cabinet, he maintains close ties to the industry and remained on the board of ArcelorMittal until he took his cabinet post. Prime minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, which exported 5.7m tons of steel to the United States in 2017, said the notion of a Canadian threat to US national security left him perplexed. \u201cOne of the things that I have to admit I\u2019m having a lot of trouble getting around is the idea that this entire thing is coming about because the president and the administration have decided that Canada and Canadian steel and aluminum is a national security threat to the United States,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview on NBC. Ross\u2019s report did not argue that Canada specifically represented a threat to the United States but said that steel imports must be restricted to allow the US industry to grow to a sustainable level. Trump, however, did not foreclose on the idea that Canada might be dangerous, reportedly telling Trudeau, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys burn down the White House?\u201d British troops burned the White House in 1814, more than 50 years before the advent of Canada as a self-governing entity. In any case, the idea that US steel is vital to national security resonates in Coatesville, whose steel plates have been used to build every operational US aircraft carrier as well as nuclear submarines, M1 Abrams tanks and key infrastructure such as bridges and power plants. The plant\u2019s standard products are plates of 160 inches and 206in wide, up to 19ins thick, cut to length. \u201cOne of the advantages that Coatesville has is the fact that it makes armor plate, which is utilized by the military. It\u2019s a substantial part of the business model there,\u201d said Paul. \u201cIf the US is building aircraft carriers and other large-ticket items like that, there will be work for mills like Coatesville.\u201d Coatesville is not the only US steel city hoping for a comeback. A blast furnace recently came back online in Granite City, Illinois, creating 300 jobs. A $240m sheet metal production line has been announced in Hickock, Arkansas, and a new rebar micro mill will come to Frostproof, Florida. An idled plant that could employ 1,000 people is scheduled to come back online in Lorain, Ohio. As chairman emeritus of Bethlehem Steel, Hank Barnette led the acquisition of the Coatesville plant from the Lukens Steel Company in 1997, before Ross bought the combined companies. \u201cIt was and is a premier supplier of plate products really in the world,\u201d Barnette said of Coatesville. \u201cI was always very proud of Lukens.\u201d Barnette said a comeback for US steel at large is possible, given enough government support over time. \u201cI think there will always be some imports \u2013 but the key is getting the operating rate up year after year after year, for three years, five years, and thereafter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a once-and-done thing.\u201d The steelworkers agree with the former CEO. \u201cWe like doing this work and we think it should be done here,\u201d said Long. \u201cMany of my co-workers share that position: if it could be made here, it should be made here.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>Donald Trump has called for Russia to be readmitted to the G7 club of world leaders, opening up a new rift with US allies who swiftly contradicted him at a contentious summit in Quebec.</p> \n<p>Although there were smiles and handshakes between Trump and his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan, there was no sign by Friday night that they were any closer on the deeply divisive issues of trade, climate change and policy towards Moscow.</p> \n<p>Trump made his comments on the way to the summit, saying: \u201cWhy are we having the meeting without Russia being in the meeting? Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a Russian television interview due to be aired on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin said that dialogue with Trump could be \u201cconstructive\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump is \u201ca serious-minded person who knows how to listen to people and respond to their arguments. This leads me to believe that dialogue may prove to be constructive.\u201d </p> \n<p>The last meeting between Trump and Putin was a brief exchange in Vietnam last November.</p> \n<p>In meetings on Friday with Emmanuel Macron of France and Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a jovial Trump claimed to have good personal relations with the leaders, and claimed at his meeting with Trudeau: \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress\u201d.</p> \n<p>After his session with the French president, Trump said: \u201cThe United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union, and we\u2019re working it out. And Emmanuel has been very helpful in that regard. And something is going to happen, and I think it will be very positive.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, a senior official at the summit in the resort town of La Malbaie said no headway had been made in talks about new tariffs the US has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/us-fires-opening-salvo-in-trade-war-with-eu-canada-and-mexico\">imposed on imports of steel and aluminium</a> \u2013 and there were strong doubts that the seven leaders would be able to agree on a joint communique by the end of the two-day meeting. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a predictable discussion,\u201d the official said. \u201cTrump recited his figures on trade. The Europeans brought up conflicting figures that showed overall they had lower tariffs than the US. It was very much six against one.\u201d </p> \n<p>A second official said that European leaders made \u201can attempt to set the record straight, pointing out that the EU and US have the most expansive trade and investment in the world, and 70% of all foreign direct investment\u201d.</p> \n<p>At one point, the president of the European commission, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker\">Jean-Claude Juncker</a>, offered to visit the US to bridge the divide between the competing US and EU narratives. Trump did not accept or reject the offer, witnesses said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/10/canada-chrystia-freeland-foreign-minister-russia-critic\">Chrystia Freeland</a>, the Canadian foreign minister, said the discussions had been \u201ccordial\u201d but it was clear the G7 leaders were far from agreement from a common statement. She said the sherpas, officials negotiating the consensus communique, had only had a few hours\u2019 sleep on Thursday night.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cWork on the communique continues,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we land ... It could be another late night for our hardworking sherpas.\u201d</p> \n<p>At a working dinner on Friday night, the leaders were due to discuss foreign policy, including Trump\u2019s talks with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, on Tuesday. </p> \n<p>With discussion of Russian policy on the agenda, Trump\u2019s comments about Russia caused consternation among his G7 partners. The country has been suspended from the summit for four years, for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/russia-shrugs-threat-expulsion-g8\"> intervention in eastern Ukraine</a> and its annexation of Crimea. <br></p> \n<p>It marked a dramatic break from the position taken by the Canadian hosts, Washington\u2019s main European allies and Trump\u2019s own state department, who all insist Moscow must withdraw from Ukraine before normal relations are resumed. <br></p> \n<p>Senior officials lined up to contradict Trump. Theresa May told Sky News: \u201cLet\u2019s remember why the G8 became the G7. And before discussions could begin on any of this, we would have to ensure Russia is amending its ways and taking a different route.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s remarks on Russia cut across a UK initiative at the summit to create a rapid response unit to combat state-sponsored aggression, such as cyber-attacks and the poisoning of dissidents which have been blamed on Russia.</p> \n<p>Freeland said Canadian officials had brought up the issue in bilateral meetings. </p> \n<p>\u201cCanada\u2019s position is absolutely clear, that there are no grounds whatsoever for bringing Russia with its current behaviour back into the G7,\u201d she said. </p> \n<p>Trump appeared to win support from the newest invitee to the G7 attendee, the incoming Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiuseppeConteIT/status/1005070731988758533\">tweeted</a>: \u201cI agree with president [Trump]. Russia should re-enter the G8.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump has called for Russia to be readmitted to the G7 club of world leaders, opening up a new rift with US allies who swiftly contradicted him at a contentious summit in Quebec. Although there were smiles and handshakes between Trump and his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan, there was no sign by Friday night that they were any closer on the deeply divisive issues of trade, climate change and policy towards Moscow. Trump made his comments on the way to the summit, saying: \u201cWhy are we having the meeting without Russia being in the meeting? Russia should be in the meeting, it should be a part of it.\u201d In a Russian television interview due to be aired on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin said that dialogue with Trump could be \u201cconstructive\u201d. Trump is \u201ca serious-minded person who knows how to listen to people and respond to their arguments. This leads me to believe that dialogue may prove to be constructive.\u201d The last meeting between Trump and Putin was a brief exchange in Vietnam last November. In meetings on Friday with Emmanuel Macron of France and Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, a jovial Trump claimed to have good personal relations with the leaders, and claimed at his meeting with Trudeau: \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress\u201d. After his session with the French president, Trump said: \u201cThe United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union, and we\u2019re working it out. And Emmanuel has been very helpful in that regard. And something is going to happen, and I think it will be very positive.\u201d However, a senior official at the summit in the resort town of La Malbaie said no headway had been made in talks about new tariffs the US has imposed on imports of steel and aluminium \u2013 and there were strong doubts that the seven leaders would be able to agree on a joint communique by the end of the two-day meeting. \u201cIt was a predictable discussion,\u201d the official said. \u201cTrump recited his figures on trade. The Europeans brought up conflicting figures that showed overall they had lower tariffs than the US. It was very much six against one.\u201d A second official said that European leaders made \u201can attempt to set the record straight, pointing out that the EU and US have the most expansive trade and investment in the world, and 70% of all foreign direct investment\u201d. At one point, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, offered to visit the US to bridge the divide between the competing US and EU narratives. Trump did not accept or reject the offer, witnesses said. Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said the discussions had been \u201ccordial\u201d but it was clear the G7 leaders were far from agreement from a common statement. She said the sherpas, officials negotiating the consensus communique, had only had a few hours\u2019 sleep on Thursday night. \u201cWork on the communique continues,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where we land ... It could be another late night for our hardworking sherpas.\u201d At a working dinner on Friday night, the leaders were due to discuss foreign policy, including Trump\u2019s talks with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, on Tuesday. With discussion of Russian policy on the agenda, Trump\u2019s comments about Russia caused consternation among his G7 partners. The country has been suspended from the summit for four years, for its intervention in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. It marked a dramatic break from the position taken by the Canadian hosts, Washington\u2019s main European allies and Trump\u2019s own state department, who all insist Moscow must withdraw from Ukraine before normal relations are resumed. Senior officials lined up to contradict Trump. Theresa May told Sky News: \u201cLet\u2019s remember why the G8 became the G7. And before discussions could begin on any of this, we would have to ensure Russia is amending its ways and taking a different route.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks on Russia cut across a UK initiative at the summit to create a rapid response unit to combat state-sponsored aggression, such as cyber-attacks and the poisoning of dissidents which have been blamed on Russia. Freeland said Canadian officials had brought up the issue in bilateral meetings. \u201cCanada\u2019s position is absolutely clear, that there are no grounds whatsoever for bringing Russia with its current behaviour back into the G7,\u201d she said. Trump appeared to win support from the newest invitee to the G7 attendee, the incoming Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who tweeted: \u201cI agree with president [Trump]. Russia should re-enter the G8. It is in the interests of all.\u201d Other European leaders challenged Conte on his statement on Friday morning, and according to officials familiar with that meeting, he insisted that Italy\u2019s policy had not changed, and that he thought Russia should only be readmitted when conditions were right. Earlier, a Russian government spokesman also appeared wary, with Dmitry Peskov, saying in a brief statement: \u201cRussia is focused on other formats, apart from the G7.\u201d The remarks, at a time when Trump\u2019s election campaign is under investigation for possible links with Moscow \u2013 raised eyebrows in Washington. \u201cThis is weak,\u201d Ben Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska, said in a swiftly issued statement. \u201cPutin is not our friend and he is not the president\u2019s buddy. He is a thug using Soviet-style aggression to wage a shadow war against America, and our leaders should act like it.\u201d Tensions were already high before the two-day summit, after a public dispute about trade between Trump and his French and Canadian counterparts, Macron and Trudeau. At stake is the prospect of the current bout of tit-for-tat tariffs between the major western economies turning into an unrestrained international trade war. The tone in the immediate run-up to thesummit showed no sign of compromise between a US president determined to disrupt the status quo to force more favourable terms for his country, and six US allies resolved to stop him. Trump is due to leave La Malbaie early on Saturday, missing sessions on climate change and the health of the oceans, to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore. Trump had sparred with other G7 leaders over trade well into the night before the summit, accusing the EU and Canada of unfair business practices, and then resumed his polemic around 6am US time, complaining about Canadian dairy tariffs. \u201cLooking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the G7 countries,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen, we come out even better!\u201d Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said the summit would be \u201cfar from easy\u201d. \u201cWhat worries me most is the fact that the rules-based international order is being challenged, quite surprisingly not by the usual suspects, but by its main architect and guarantor, the US,\u201d Tusk said at a press conference in La Malbaie. \u201cWe will not stop trying to convince president Trump that undermining this order makes no sense at all, because it will only play into the hands of those who seek a new post-west order, where liberal democracy and fundamental freedoms would cease to exist.

The FTSE 100 shed 23 points, or 0.3%, while German\u2019s DAX lost 44 points, or 0.35%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was the big loser, dropping by almost 2% as traders fretted about the new Italian government. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: European stocks spent much of the session in the red as trade tensions weighed on investor sentiment. The G7 meeting gets under way today in Quebec, and investors are cautious as certain trading relationships are a little strained. Those talks in Quebec will run for hours and continue tomorrow (although without Donald Trump). Leaders are being pushed to make gender equality a top priority, alongside climate change and trade. Keep an eye on our website for the latest developments. Goodnight! GW Newsflash: British satellite company Inmarsat had found itself in a takeover battle. Shares in the company jumped by 13.5% today, sparking speculation that the company could be \u2018in play\u2019...and it is! Inmarsat has just told the City that it has rejected an approach from US rival Echostar. It says: The Board of Inmarsat plc notes today\u2019s recent press speculation and movement in its share price and confirms that it received a highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal from Echostar Corporation in relation to the potential acquisition of the entire issued, and to be issued, share capital of Inmarsat (the \u201cProposal\u201d). After carefully considering the Proposal with its advisers the Board rejected the Proposal on the basis that it very significantly undervalued Inmarsat and its standalone prospects. The Board remains highly confident in the independent strategy and prospects of Inmarsat. Echostar now has until 6 July to make a firm offer, or walk away. Inmarsat is now valued at around \u00a32.2bn, following todays share price move. Italy\u2019s debt has come under pressure today, sending yields on Italian government bonds higher. The FT says the are several factors, both at home and in Frankfurt..... Strategists are uncertain over how the newly-formed populist government will work with Brussels, and also over its fiscal plans. At the same time, a string of hawkish speeches from ECB policymakers earlier this week have revved up expectations that the central bank will announce next week the end of its bond buying programme. Quantitative easing has been a boon to eurozone government debt, helping push yields lower. European Council president Donald Tusk, who is attending the G7 meeting, insists that European delegates will maintain a united front. Tusk also played down the idea that Russia could be readmitted to the gathering, despite Donald Trump\u2019s comments earlier: He said: \u201cThis morning I had the first and very good, promising meeting with Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and I am convinced that here at the G7 we will have a fully united European position on all issues. Including on Russia. I am not talking about details but about the more general common line. Tusk also put his finger on the challenge facing world leaders: BT\u2019s shares are still near the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard this afternoon, as traders digest the exit of CEO Gavin Patterson. They\u2019re currently up 1.1% at 205p. Back in 2013, when Patterson was appointed, they were worth 300p, so there\u2019s been some value destruction on his watch. BT\u2019s shares did rise early in Patterson\u2019s tenure, hitting \u00a35 in 2016. But they then fell back as BT struggled to hit growth and earnings targets - despite spending a lot of money on sports rights. Last month\u2019s profit warning, released alongside the latest strategy, was the last straw, sending shares to six-year lows. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cPerhaps fittingly, Gavin Patterson\u2019s tenure was very much a game of two halves. The rise of BT\u2019s Sport coverage, which has stepped up to challenge the dominance of Sky initially brought some good times for investors. However, it\u2019s been a different story over the last two years. Since 2016, BT\u2019s share price graph resembles something of a black run; pretty much always on a downward trend and with a few nasty cliffs here and there. Ultimately, this is what\u2019s behind the change. Shareholder confidence has followed the share price down, and with BT embarking on a crucial restructure, the board has decided it\u2019s time for a change. Here\u2019s our news story about Trump\u2019s comments: US stock markets have followed Europe and Asia\u2019s lead, and dipped in early trading. It\u2019s a modest fall, though; the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 40-odd point, or 0.15%., while the Nasdaq is down 0.5%. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has reportedly backed Trump\u2019s call for Russia to be reinstated. It raises the prospect of the G7 becoming the G8 again... unless it shrinks to become the G6 first, of course. Breaking: The pound is falling as the Europe Union\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, gives a thumping thumbs down to the UK\u2019s latest proposal. Barnier has rejected Theresa May\u2019s proposal that Britain should stay in the customs union until the end of 2021 unless a new customs agreement is agreed once Brexit has occured. He is telling journalists in Brussels that the backstop cannot apply to the whole UK, but could apply to Northern Ireland. Barnier also takes issue with the \u2018time-limited\u2019 nature of the UK\u2019s offer. He insists that \u201cbackstop means backstop\u201d (a wry jibe at May\u2019s claim that \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d). This has to be a backstop that provides a guarantee under all circumstances. This is another blow to the UK\u2019s position - which was only agreed yesterday after crunch talks between May and Brexit secretary David Davis. Barnier also claimed that the UK\u2019s position is \u201cparadoxical\u201d (because London wants to leave the EU but maintain many of its advantages). The pound has dropped by 0.5% against the US dollar, or 0.66 of a cent, to $1.336. Our Politics Live blog has all the action: Trump has added further spice to the G7 meeting, by telling reporters in Washington that Russian president Vladimir Putin should be joining the throng in Quebec: Russia\u2019s membership of the G8 (as it then was) was suspended after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Given events since, such as the Salisbury Novichok attack, I don\u2019t think Putin is welcome back.... Trump also declared that Canada, the EU and Mexico all treat America very badly when it come to trade, meaning we can dial down expectations for a successful G7 even lower.... Donald Trump\u2019s social media sledging isn\u2019t doing much for the mood on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is expected to fall by 136 points at the open, or around 0.5%. America\u2019s increased isolation on the world stage is worrying traders, says Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA. While Trump has at times appeared friendly with certain other heads of state in the past, the relationships have at least appeared to have become more hostile since tariffs were imposed on the European Union, Canada and Mexico by the US last week. The G7 meeting has become more like a G6+1, with Trump choosing to isolate the US on a number of issues from trade to Iran and climate change. The Nasdaq is heading for an 0.8% drop, with Apple called down 2% following reports it is taking a \u201ccautious\u201d approach toward upcoming iPhone shipments this year. Trump has thrown down the gauntlet: We\u2019ll try to hold the president to that last pledge.... However, I suspect the talks will mostly centre on the recent tariffs imposed by the United States on its allies: In another sign that America is detaching from fellow advanced economies, Donald Trump will actually leave the G7 meeting early. The president is due to leave Quebec on Saturday morning, meaning he\u2019ll miss the summit\u2019s second day. Trump is flying to Singapore for his historic meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un. The talks could lead to a thawing of tensions between the two countries; but with such unpredictable leaders, anything is possible. My colleague Julian Borger explains how the Trump-Kim meeting could unfold: Trump has sought to play down expectations, characterising the meeting as \u201cgetting-to-know-you, plus\u201d. But without a substantial \u201cplus\u201d in the form of progress in the direction of disarmament, the meeting will widely be deemed a failure. And to achieve that progress, Trump will have to make significant gestures towards what Kim wants most \u2013 security guarantees. Both leaders will go into the Singapore meeting with cards in their hands, representing quick, deliverable concessions. The big question next week will be which cards they play and in what sequence. At a minimum, Kim will be expected to formalise the current suspension of nuclear and missile testing. He could go further by declaring a cap on his existing arsenal freeze on other nuclear activity like uranium enrichment. His biggest element of his opening offer, however, would be a statement on his plans to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, and here everything will be in the details \u2013 how clearly denuclearisation is defined, and whether Kim commits to a timetable. Just in: Donald Trump is limbering up for the G7 meeting by firing another attack at Canada over trade tariffs: Trump is referring to Canada\u2019s \u201cSupply management\u201d regime, a long-running point of dispute between the two countries. This system specifies fixed prices paid to farmers, strict quotas for how much they can produce, and a tariff wall to prevent cheaper imports from abroad. The result: stable incomes for farmers, who are protected from bankruptcy in lean times, at the cost of higher prices for Canadian consumers. American farmers, though, want to send their own milk and butter north, and Trump is pushing their case. Emerging market currencies are being hit badly today, as investors scramble into the safety of the US dollar instead. The South African rand, the Turkish lira and the Indian rupee have all suffered sharp falls. This kind of action puts pressure on domestic policymakers to consider raising interest rates to prevent capital flight - a move that also hurts economic growth. Yesterday, Turkey\u2019s central bank hikes its benchmark rate to a blistering 17.75%, from 16.5%, in an attempt to prop up the lira. Angela Merkel has received some unwelcome news as she prepares for the G7 meeting -- German industrial output and exports both fell in April. Factory output across Germany shrank by 1% in April, dashing expectations that it would rise by 0.3%. The Federal Statistics Office also reported that German exports fell by 0.3% in April while imports rose by 2.2%. That helps to narrow Germany\u2019s trade surplus, so could be welcomed by its neighbours. The wider concern, though, is that trade war fears are hurting demand for German goods. Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management is gloriously unimpressed by this weekend\u2019s G7 shindig, arguing that little will be achieved in Quebec. But markets could slide if Donald Trump falls out badly with fellow world leaders. Donovan says: Several heads of government disappear off for a taxpayer-financed weekend mini-break in Canada today. The G5, G7, G8, and now G6 plus 1 have never really accomplished very much after the first burst of enthusiasm with the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s. This meeting will be no different. Because the G6 plus 1 is about spin not substance, the risks for markets come from the visual from this meeting. The US is looking isolated. This is not the isolationism and protectionism of the 1930s. In the 1930s everyone put up trade barriers against everyone else. This time the US is putting up trade barriers against everyone else, and everyone else is carrying on just as before. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says the international trade system is more complex than Donald Trump suggests.... Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the EU and Canada have sent traders racing to sell risky assets, says Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index. Interest rate realities are sinking back in ahead of what\u2019s going to be a not particularly cordial G7 summit in Canada. It\u2019s little wonder that risk-aversion has returned. Odeluga points out that G7 summits can often disappoint -- but his week\u2019s one could be especially worrying: Even under \u2018normal\u2019 circumstances, markets tend to write-off the chances that G7 summits will result in concrete communiques with lasting impact. The current U.S. administration back-tracked on climate-related pledges within weeks of the last meeting. It also took its first steps on the trade war path despite the anti-\u201cprotectionism\u201d sentiments addressed in the prior G7 statement. With new U.S. tariffs now lodged against all but one of the remaining six members and Trump tweeting his still combative mood overnight, some leaders might be wondering if there might be more productive ways to spend their time this weekend. No wonder markets are falling. Overnight, Donald Trump launched a fierce attack on his fellow G7 leaders via Twitter, accusing Europe and Canada of treating America unfairly. Trump signed off that he\u2019s \u2018looking forward\u2019 to meeting Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macon in Quebec.... having further stoked the feud between the US and the rest. Macron responded more tactfully, tweeting that tensions are rising everywhere, and the G7 meeting will be demanding. A wave of selling has swept through Europe\u2019s trading floors this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has shed 58 points or 0.75%, to 7645 points. Nearly every share is down -- BT jumped 2.5% at the open, but has now subsided. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames geopolitical worries: A likely feisty G7 meeting in Quebec appears to be the main thing driving the markets lower. Investors are either worried that nothing will get resolved, or Trump will become more entrenched in his aggressive approach to trade. Germany\u2019s DAX has also started the day badly - down 1.1% - while France\u2019s CAC is down 0.6%. BT tweets... ...because the incumbent is being kicked out by the chairman?... Geoff Cutmore of CNBC questions whether BT will stick with Patterson\u2019s strategy to revitalise BT, and cut 13,000 jobs, if he\u2019s now surplus to requirements. Cutmore\u2019s colleague, Karen Tso, points out that transforming BT into a tech-focused company is a huge challenge: It emerged earlier this week that BT shareholders were agitating for change, with top investors demanding talks with chairman Jan du Plessis. We wrote on Monday that du Plessis has already held meetings with investors, with more planned. Clearly the mood wasn\u2019t great. As one top investor told the FT: \u201cI don\u2019t have much faith in Gavin....Since he took over [five years ago], it has not been a happy time for shareholders. I am not sure he is the right man for the job.\u201d Today\u2019s statement suggests that du Plessis and the rest of the board came to the same conclusion, deciding that \u2018a change of leadership\u2019 is needed. As Richard Fletcher of The Times puts it, du Plessis has now \u2018ousted\u2019 Patterson: A wobbly day\u2019s trading in Asia has seen Japan\u2019s Nikkei drop 0.5%, China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index lose 1.5%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng lose 1.7%. David Madden of CMC Markets says G7 worries are mounting. The G7 meeting starts today in Quebec. Traders will be paying attention to see if any progress is made regarding trade talks. President Tump is in the eye of the trade storm, and he is letting the world know he means business, and he is determined to get the best deal for the US. At the moment, investors aren\u2019t overly concerned about the state of play, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a pain threshold. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some breaking news to start the morning: Gavin Patterson is stepping down as chief executive of BT, in the face of criticism from investors. The telecoms giant has announced that Patterson will leave later this year -- after concluding that a \u2018change of leadership\u2019 is needed. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The company said that it had already started the process of looking for his successor, and expected to appoint a new chief executive in the second half of the year. Jan du Plessis, chairman of BT, thanked Patterson for his contribution but said the company needed a change in leadership. He said: \u201cThe board is fully supportive of the strategy recently set out by Gavin and his team. The broader reaction to our recent results announcement has though demonstrated to Gavin and me that there is a need for a change of leadership to deliver this strategy.\u201d Patterson was clearly under pressure; BT\u2019s share price hit its lowest level since 2012 last month. It emerged earlier this week that some investors were losing patience with Patterson, who has been spending billions of pounds on sports rights such as Premier League football in an attempt to attract customers to its TV service. This looks like a rather humiliating way to go, just four weeks after announcing a new strategy and thousands of job cuts. More on that shortly.... Also coming up today Investors will be watching La Malbaie in Quebec, as Canada hosts the G7 meeting of world leaders. It could turn into a G6 +1, though, as America faces criticism over its trade policies from the UK, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada. European markets are expected to fall, with the FTSE 100 called down 35 points, after Asian markets dropped back. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says \u2018risk aversion\u2019 is rising, as investors fear the meeting will be fraught. Given the quiet economic calendar today, the continuing trade spat between the US its closet allies will attract a good deal of attention as the G7 summit begins. The broader US market posted its first loss in 5 days as the recent equity rally, and more specifically tech rally, faltered, whilst investors started to show unease over the potential climate at the G7 Summit. Souring investor sentiment resulted in a softer session for Asia and indicates a weaker start for Europe on the open.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump sounded off on presidential pardons, international tensions over trade and his embattled environmental chief, Scott Pruitt, on Friday as he departed Washington for what is likely to be a combative G7 summit in Canada. Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn, the freewheeling president also said he would like to meet with the NFL athletes who he has sharply criticized for kneeling during the national anthem. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask them to recommend to me people who were unfairly treated,\u201d Trump said. Trump has previously called for the predominantly black athletes who take a knee during the national anthem to be fired, prompting a rules change from the NFL that sought to penalize teams whose players did not stand. Trump\u2019s comments about the movement, which was designed to draw attention to police brutality and criminal justice, have prompted several championship players to boycott invitations from the White House. Trump, who recently commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a first-time non-violent drug offender, also suggested he was open to revisiting other cases of those who had been wronged by the criminal justice system. The president said he was considering a posthumous pardon of the legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who was convicted in 1967 of evading the draft for the Vietnam war. But Ali\u2019s conviction was already overturned by the supreme court. He also defended his aggressive stance toward US trading partners, stating: \u201cRight now, we are not going to live with the deals the way they are.\u201d \u201cEuropean Union treats us very unfairly. Canada, very unfairly. Mexico, very unfairly,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that being said, I think we\u2019ll probably very easily make a deal.\u201d Trump has faced outward pushback from foreign leaders, including the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and French president, Emmanuel Macron, over his decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on a number of America\u2019s closest western allies. On Thursday, Macron signaled Trump\u2019s arrival at the G7 would be met with acrimony, tweeting: \u201cThe American President may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be.\u201d Trump responded hours later with a tweet of his own, refusing to back down from a trade policy that has been criticized by members of his own party in Washington. \u201cPlease tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create nonmonetary barriers,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.\u201d In another extraordinary break from US allies, Trump on Friday called for Russia to be reinstated to the G7 club of world leaders. Russia was suspended from the former G8 in 2014 after its annexation of Crimea. \u201cWhy are we having the meeting without Russia being in the meeting?\u201d Trump said of the summit, which is being held in Charlevoix, Canada. \u201cRussia should be in this meeting \u2026 They should let Russia come back in, because we should have Russia at the negotiating table.\u201d The White House has said Trump will depart the G7 summit early and instead head to Singapore to begin preparations for a high-profile summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on 12 June. He also confirmed that first lady, Melania Trump, who has been largely absent from the public eye in recent weeks, will not be accompanying him on his trips to Canada and Singapore. Trump attributed his wife\u2019s absence to a recent procedure she underwent for a benign kidney problem. \u201cShe wanted to go. Can\u2019t fly for one month, the doctors say,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe had a big operation. That was close to a four-hour operation. She\u2019s doing great.\u201d Trump also addressed the mounting controversy over a series of ethics violations by Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cScott Pruitt is doing a great job within the walls of the EPA. I mean, we\u2019re setting records,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOutside, he\u2019s being attacked very viciously by the press, and I\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s blameless, but we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",

          "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Imagine Trump doing Brexit\u2019</h2> <p>Hello, welcome to Friday. I\u2019m Warren Murray with more jargon to add to the Brexit lexicon. </p> <p>Theresa May has bent to secretary David Davis\u2019s demands over the \u201cbackstop\u201d that would keep Britain in the EU customs union for the sake of an open Irish border. But divisions persist in the cabinet over Brexit \u2013 as evidenced by a secret recording of Boris Johnson, where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/pm-confident-david-davis-will-stay-in-job-no-10-says\">warned of a \u201cmeltdown\u201d on the road to exiting the European Union</a> and dismissed the Irish border issue as \u201cfolly\u201d. </p> <p>The foreign secretary criticised Philip Hammond\u2019s Treasury as \u201cthe heart of remain\u201d, saying it had focused on \u201cmumbo jumbo\u201d predictions about short-term disruption, instead of the potential gains from leaving the EU. \u201cImagine Trump doing Brexit,\u201d Johnson told Tory dining partners at Chatham House. \u201cHe\u2019d go in bloody hard \u2026 There\u2019d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he\u2019d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It\u2019s a very, very good thought.\u201d</p> <p>May has agreed to a backstop \u201cfudge\u201d that says the UK \u201cexpects\u201d new, permanent customs arrangements with the EU to be in place by the end of December 2021. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/mays-backstop-concession-pulls-davis-back-from-the-edge\">It placates Davis, while remainers say it is cosmetic</a> with no legal force. On a plane to the G7 summit in Canada, May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/may-refuses-to-give-cast-iron-guarantee-over-customs-backstop\">refused to give a cast-iron guarantee that the backstop would only be temporary</a>. She emphasised it might never be used. \u201cI\u2019ve always been clear that this was time limited and as we\u2019ve said today [Thursday] the end state at the latest will be in by the end of 2021 and we will be working to ensure that it is in earlier than that.\u201d Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, made what appeared to be a quip on Twitter: \u201cIs it an all-weather backstop?\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Life on Mars \u2013 </strong>Yes it\u2019s another of those headlines but in this case the facts behind it are quite promising. The venerable Mars Curiosity rover has drilled into a piece of mudstone and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/07/nasa-mars-rover-finds-organic-matter-in-ancient-lake-bed\">found chemical traces of organic compounds</a>. \u201cIt is not telling us that life was there,\u201d says Jennifer Eigenbrode, a Nasa biogeochemist, \u201cbut it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.\u201d It points to the Mars of long ago having had lakes that held the carbon-based compounds necessary for life similar to our own. Could life still be there? \u201cThese molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,\u201d said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist. \u201cThis is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>G7 begins \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/g7-summit-will-be-a-political-fistfight-for-european-members\">looks set to clash with everyone else as the G7 summit gets under way in Quebec today</a>. France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy will be lobbying the US president to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. The UK, Germany and France will demand that European companies having dealings with Iran are spared from US sanctions. More pressing are steel and aluminium tariffs, with the EU poised to impose retaliatory measures on American goods ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/eu-tariffs-us-imports-july-steel-aluminium\">jeans to motorbikes</a>. Sharp words have circulated between several of the leaders: Emmanuel Macron of France has called for the G7-minus-one to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/macron-g7-summit-trump-trade-policy-hegemony\">resist Trump\u2019s attempts to impose a \u201ccrude hegemony\u201d</a> while Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau called Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cunilateral and illegal\u201d. Trump hit back, claiming that Canadian trade policy was \u201ckilling our agriculture\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Daily Mail\u2019s next editor \u2013 </strong>Geordie Greig has been drafted across from the helm of the Mail on Sunday to take over from Paul Dacre as editor of the Daily Mail. Greig has been described as \u201c50% courtier, 50% old-school hack\u201d by a former boss. In contrast to Dacre, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/07/geordie-greig-daily-mail-editor-mean-streets-high-society\">at the Mail on Sunday he took an anti-Brexit line</a>. Greig also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/07/geordie-greig-daily-mail-editor-mean-streets-high-society\">formerly edited the Evening Standard</a>, and wrote a biography of the artist Lucian Freud.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Left to die\u2019 \u2013 </strong>A 38-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer was denied potentially life-saving chemotherapy for nearly six weeks in what refugee support groups say is another manifestation of the \u201chostile environment\u201d policy. Kelemua Mulat, from Ethiopia, is now receiving the treatment after the Christie hospital in Manchester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/07/home-office-prevented-asylum-seekers-urgent-cancer-treatment\">managed to override a Home Office decision</a> that she was not eligible for NHS care. Mulat has been refused asylum but is appealing, saying she is part of a pro-democracy group whose members have been sentenced to death or long jail terms.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018New room in the Great Pyramid\u2019 \u2013 </strong>An unheard album of John Coltrane\u2019s music has been found and will be released at the end of this month.

          "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Imagine Trump doing Brexit\u2019 Hello, welcome to Friday. I\u2019m Warren Murray with more jargon to add to the Brexit lexicon. Theresa May has bent to secretary David Davis\u2019s demands over the \u201cbackstop\u201d that would keep Britain in the EU customs union for the sake of an open Irish border. But divisions persist in the cabinet over Brexit \u2013 as evidenced by a secret recording of Boris Johnson, where he warned of a \u201cmeltdown\u201d on the road to exiting the European Union and dismissed the Irish border issue as \u201cfolly\u201d. The foreign secretary criticised Philip Hammond\u2019s Treasury as \u201cthe heart of remain\u201d, saying it had focused on \u201cmumbo jumbo\u201d predictions about short-term disruption, instead of the potential gains from leaving the EU. \u201cImagine Trump doing Brexit,\u201d Johnson told Tory dining partners at Chatham House. \u201cHe\u2019d go in bloody hard \u2026 There\u2019d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he\u2019d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It\u2019s a very, very good thought.\u201d May has agreed to a backstop \u201cfudge\u201d that says the UK \u201cexpects\u201d new, permanent customs arrangements with the EU to be in place by the end of December 2021. It placates Davis, while remainers say it is cosmetic with no legal force. On a plane to the G7 summit in Canada, May refused to give a cast-iron guarantee that the backstop would only be temporary. She emphasised it might never be used. \u201cI\u2019ve always been clear that this was time limited and as we\u2019ve said today [Thursday] the end state at the latest will be in by the end of 2021 and we will be working to ensure that it is in earlier than that.\u201d Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, made what appeared to be a quip on Twitter: \u201cIs it an all-weather backstop?\u201d * * * Life on Mars \u2013 Yes it\u2019s another of those headlines but in this case the facts behind it are quite promising. The venerable Mars Curiosity rover has drilled into a piece of mudstone and found chemical traces of organic compounds. \u201cIt is not telling us that life was there,\u201d says Jennifer Eigenbrode, a Nasa biogeochemist, \u201cbut it is saying that everything organisms really needed to live in that kind of environment, all of that was there.\u201d It points to the Mars of long ago having had lakes that held the carbon-based compounds necessary for life similar to our own. Could life still be there? \u201cThese molecules could have been part of life, but they could also have been food for life,\u201d said Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist. \u201cThis is very promising for the preservation of potential ancient life on the planet.\u201d * * * G7 begins \u2013 Donald Trump looks set to clash with everyone else as the G7 summit gets under way in Quebec today. France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy will be lobbying the US president to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. The UK, Germany and France will demand that European companies having dealings with Iran are spared from US sanctions. More pressing are steel and aluminium tariffs, with the EU poised to impose retaliatory measures on American goods ranging from jeans to motorbikes. Sharp words have circulated between several of the leaders: Emmanuel Macron of France has called for the G7-minus-one to resist Trump\u2019s attempts to impose a \u201ccrude hegemony\u201d while Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau called Trump\u2019s tariffs \u201cunilateral and illegal\u201d. Trump hit back, claiming that Canadian trade policy was \u201ckilling our agriculture\u201d. * * * Daily Mail\u2019s next editor \u2013 Geordie Greig has been drafted across from the helm of the Mail on Sunday to take over from Paul Dacre as editor of the Daily Mail. Greig has been described as \u201c50% courtier, 50% old-school hack\u201d by a former boss. In contrast to Dacre, at the Mail on Sunday he took an anti-Brexit line. Greig also formerly edited the Evening Standard, and wrote a biography of the artist Lucian Freud. * * * \u2018Left to die\u2019 \u2013 A 38-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer was denied potentially life-saving chemotherapy for nearly six weeks in what refugee support groups say is another manifestation of the \u201chostile environment\u201d policy. Kelemua Mulat, from Ethiopia, is now receiving the treatment after the Christie hospital in Manchester managed to override a Home Office decision that she was not eligible for NHS care. Mulat has been refused asylum but is appealing, saying she is part of a pro-democracy group whose members have been sentenced to death or long jail terms. * * * \u2018New room in the Great Pyramid\u2019 \u2013 An unheard album of John Coltrane\u2019s music has been found and will be released at the end of this month. The session, recorded on 6 March 1963 in New Jersey, features the legendary jazz saxophonist in what is regarded as his \u201cclassic quartet\u201d. The master tape was lost but it turned out Coltrane had given a copy to his soon-to-be ex-wife and it remained in her family. Both Directions at Once: the Lost Album comes out on 29 June. The British jazz and improv saxophonist Evan Parker told the Guardian: \u201cThis release is most welcome \u2013 the \u2018classic quartet\u2019 was where Coltrane did his best work.\u201d Lunchtime read: \u2018We had a name for ourselves: Travellers\u2019 \u201cI can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations; I was brought up to know the Romani language,\u201d writes Damian Le Bas as he goes back on the road to reconnect with his Traveller roots. \u201cI was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm; a mental Gypsyland.\u201d Eight months into his journey to rediscover the stopping places of Traveller life, \u201cI realised how sparsely furnished my van was \u2026 bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I\u2019ve been missing a trick.\u201d With his Mum\u2019s help the van was soon decked out: \u201cAn Islamic purple velvet hanging \u2026 matching Bedouin horse-cloths \u2026 brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.\u201d Sport Gareth Southgate has admitted he has \u201cserious decisions\u201d to make over his preferred lineup for England\u2019s opening group game at the World Cup after a much changed team impressed in the 2-0 dismissal of Costa Rica, which served as a productive run-out for a starting team of Plan Bs and second-choicers. England football fans visiting Russia are at serious risk of homophobic, racist and anti-British attacks and have been offered only \u201cvague reassurance\u201d about their safety by the Foreign Office and police, MPs have warned. Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen has rejected suggestions he should change his driving approach, saying he might \u201cheadbutt someone\u201d if he is questioned any further on being involved in incidents at every race this season.

The country\u2019s upper chamber voted 56-30 on Thursday in favour of legislation aimed at ending more than 90 years of prohibition. The senate, however, added nearly four dozen amendments, meaning the legislation will now return to the House of Commons for consideration. The federal Liberal government, led by Justin Trudeau, introduced the legislation last year in a bid to make Canada the second country in the world to legalise the cannabis, after Uruguay. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada. The legislation divided the responsibilities between the federal and provincial governments, with Ottawa responsible for regulating production while leaving it to provinces and territories to decide how the drug will be distributed and sold. Once passed and implemented, those who want to grow their own marijuana will be limited to four plants per household. Canadians will be allowed to carry up to 30 grams of dried cannabis for personal use while those who sell or give marijuana to minors or who drive under its influence will face stiff penalties. Since becoming the Liberal leader in 2013, Trudeau has argued that the decriminalisation and regulation of marijuana would help keep the drug away from children and ensure profits don\u2019t end up in the hands of what he described as \u201ccriminal elements.\u201d While the sale of recreational marijuana is not expected to begin until August or September, the senate vote was one of the major obstacles standing in the way of legalisation as Conservatives senators sought to block the initiative.

In particular the US has complained about access for its dairy products, and Canada says the US imposes unfair tariffs on its lumber exports. Ottawa has called for the disputes to be resolved by arbitration, and points out that Canada is the biggest market for US agricultural exports, and second biggest market for dairy exports.</p> <p>The pointed exchange between the leaders highlighted deep divisions that were already clearly evident before Friday\u2019s summit. Trump is expected to arrive at mid-morning on Friday, and hold closed-door meetings at La Malbaie, a summer resort on the St Lawrence river. He is due to hold bilateral sessions with Trudeau and Macron, and met the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in Washington on Thursday. The president has no plans to see Theresa May or Angela Merkel, with whom his relations are even frostier.</p> <p>Trump is due to leave the summit several hours early on Saturday morning, to fly direct to his next engagement, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/north-korea-trump-latest-news-kim-jong-un-meeting-us-\">summit with the North Korean leader</a>, Kim Jong-un in Singapore. </p> <p>In their remarks to reporters, Trudeau and Macron emphasised the importance of maintaining dialogue and courtesy in relations with Trump, arguing the meeting was an essential forum for finding common ground and resolving differences. </p> <p>\u201cThe G7 is an opportunity to meet to have frank and open discussions between countries that are longtime allies and friends,\u201d Trudeau argued. </p> <p>Both men, however, voiced anger over Trump\u2019s imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs against close allies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/donald-trump-justin-trudeau-burning-down-white-house-tariffs\">supposedly on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds</a>. The EU and Canada have imposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/eu-tariffs-us-imports-july-steel-aluminium\">reciprocal sanctions</a> on US goods and have taken their complaint to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/eu-starts-retaliation-against-donald-trumps-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs\">World Trade Organisation</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/donald-trump-justin-trudeau-burning-down-white-house-tariffs\">Trump to Trudeau in testy tariff call: 'Didn't you guys burn down the White House?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trudeau described the tariffs as \u201cunilateral and illegal\u201d and the national security pretext as \u201crisible\u201d. He added that Trump\u2019s \u201cunacceptable actions are going to harm his own citizens\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is American jobs that are going to be lost because of the actions of this administration,\u201d the Canadian prime minister added.</p> <p>Macron was even more emphatic, calling on the other G7 members to resist what he warned was a potential US drift towards \u201cfurther isolationism and \u201ccrude hegemony\u201d.</p> <p>Macron has <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/diplomacy/article/2144344/french-president-emmanuel-macron-vows-stand-against-chinese\">previously accused China</a> of pursuing hegemony in Asia.</p> <p>\u201cThe six other countries of the G7 represent a market which is bigger than the American market,\u201d the French president said. \u201cI believe in cooperation and multilateralism because I will resist hegemony with all my strength. Hegemony is might makes right. Hegemony is the end of the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>Macron said he would do everything in his power to help Trudeau\u2019s presidency of the G7 to succeed and produce a joint statement on Saturday that can be signed by all seven members. </p> <p>However, he argued that other countries should be ready to have a \u201cG6 plus one\u201d outcome, sticking to a text that enshrines their common values, even if Trump does not sign it. </p> <p>\u201cThe desire for all seven to sign a text can\u2019t be stronger than our requirements for the contents of that text,\u201d Macron said at a joint press conference with Trudeau in Ottawa on the eve of the summit. \u201cI think we would be making an error if we said we are ready to give up everything, not to talk about the Paris accord or climate, or trade, just to have that signature.\u201d</p> <p>At last year\u2019s G7 summit in Sicily, the leaders all signed a communique, but the statement made clear there were deep differences on the Paris climate change accord.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/07/the-g7-minus-one-trump-packs-wrecking-ball-for-canada-summit\">The G7 minus one: Trump packs wrecking ball for Canada summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe American president may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a six country agreement if need be,\u201d he said, but added that US workers would be the first to suffer from a trade war between Europe and the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all engaged in conflicts in Syria, in Iraq, in the Sahel, in different places in the world.

For me it\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d</p> <p>Macron expressed support for Trump in his expected summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, but also warned that the US president\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">abrogation</a> last month of a 2015 multilateral deal on the Iranian nuclear programme, cast doubt on the credibility of such agreements. </p> <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose sanctions against European companies that continue to do business with Tehran, an effort the US has said it will resist.</p> <p>Macron said the message of other G7 leaders to Trump on the Iran deal should be: \u201cYou\u2019re not comfortable with an agreement signed by your predecessor, maybe just because it was signed by your predecessor, but don\u2019t stop others from respecting it and don\u2019t push Iran to leave, because today it\u2019s the best protection we have.\u201d<br></p>",

The challenge brought a tweeted response from Trump, claiming Macron and Trudeau\u2019s governments were pursuing unfair trade practices at the expense of US producers. \u201cLook forward to seeing them tomorrow,\u201d he signed off sardonically. In a second tweet he said Canadian trade policy was \u201ckilling our Agriculture.\u201d Even under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada and the US have had long-running disputes about subsidies, tariffs and restrictive practices. In particular the US has complained about access for its dairy products, and Canada says the US imposes unfair tariffs on its lumber exports. Ottawa has called for the disputes to be resolved by arbitration, and points out that Canada is the biggest market for US agricultural exports, and second biggest market for dairy exports. The pointed exchange between the leaders highlighted deep divisions that were already clearly evident before Friday\u2019s summit. Trump is expected to arrive at mid-morning on Friday, and hold closed-door meetings at La Malbaie, a summer resort on the St Lawrence river. He is due to hold bilateral sessions with Trudeau and Macron, and met the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in Washington on Thursday. The president has no plans to see Theresa May or Angela Merkel, with whom his relations are even frostier. Trump is due to leave the summit several hours early on Saturday morning, to fly direct to his next engagement, a summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un in Singapore. In their remarks to reporters, Trudeau and Macron emphasised the importance of maintaining dialogue and courtesy in relations with Trump, arguing the meeting was an essential forum for finding common ground and resolving differences. \u201cThe G7 is an opportunity to meet to have frank and open discussions between countries that are longtime allies and friends,\u201d Trudeau argued. Both men, however, voiced anger over Trump\u2019s imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs against close allies, supposedly on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. The EU and Canada have imposed reciprocal sanctions on US goods and have taken their complaint to the World Trade Organisation. Trudeau described the tariffs as \u201cunilateral and illegal\u201d and the national security pretext as \u201crisible\u201d. He added that Trump\u2019s \u201cunacceptable actions are going to harm his own citizens\u201d. \u201cIt is American jobs that are going to be lost because of the actions of this administration,\u201d the Canadian prime minister added. Macron was even more emphatic, calling on the other G7 members to resist what he warned was a potential US drift towards \u201cfurther isolationism and \u201ccrude hegemony\u201d. Macron has previously accused China of pursuing hegemony in Asia. \u201cThe six other countries of the G7 represent a market which is bigger than the American market,\u201d the French president said. \u201cI believe in cooperation and multilateralism because I will resist hegemony with all my strength. Hegemony is might makes right. Hegemony is the end of the rule of law.\u201d Macron said he would do everything in his power to help Trudeau\u2019s presidency of the G7 to succeed and produce a joint statement on Saturday that can be signed by all seven members. However, he argued that other countries should be ready to have a \u201cG6 plus one\u201d outcome, sticking to a text that enshrines their common values, even if Trump does not sign it. \u201cThe desire for all seven to sign a text can\u2019t be stronger than our requirements for the contents of that text,\u201d Macron said at a joint press conference with Trudeau in Ottawa on the eve of the summit. \u201cI think we would be making an error if we said we are ready to give up everything, not to talk about the Paris accord or climate, or trade, just to have that signature.\u201d At last year\u2019s G7 summit in Sicily, the leaders all signed a communique, but the statement made clear there were deep differences on the Paris climate change accord. \u201cThe American president may not mind being isolated, but neither do we mind signing a six country agreement if need be,\u201d he said, but added that US workers would be the first to suffer from a trade war between Europe and the US. \u201cWe are all engaged in conflicts in Syria, in Iraq, in the Sahel, in different places in the world. We are allies. Our soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder to defend liberty and our values,\u201d Macron said. \u201cYou can\u2019t, among allies in this international context, start a trade war. For me it\u2019s a question of principle.\u201d Macron expressed support for Trump in his expected summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, but also warned that the US president\u2019s abrogation last month of a 2015 multilateral deal on the Iranian nuclear programme, cast doubt on the credibility of such agreements. The Trump administration has threatened to impose sanctions against European companies that continue to do business with Tehran, an effort the US has said it will resist. Macron said the message of other G7 leaders to Trump on the Iran deal should be: \u201cYou\u2019re not comfortable with an agreement signed by your predecessor, maybe just because it was signed by your predecessor, but don\u2019t stop others from respecting it and don\u2019t push Iran to leave, because today it\u2019s the best protection we have.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "Theresa May landed in Quebec on Thursday, swapping bruising rows with cabinet colleagues over Brexit for what could also be bruising confrontations between the US president Donald Trump and the other G7 members over tariffs and foreign policy. The 44th meeting of the G7 group of the world\u2019s seven richest countries is taking place deep in rural Quebec in eastern Canada. The venue is a vast ski-and-golf resort that sits by a lake in the basin of a 34-mile crater left by a meteor strike millions of years ago. It writes its own metaphors. But the remote beauty of the landscape will not be matched by the atmosphere inside. The worthy agenda of gender equality and economic prosperity proposed by the host, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is already deep in the shadow of an unprecedented series of rows among the G7 members. The combined pressure of six \u2013 France, Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy (the latter largely absent resolving domestic issues) \u2013 to persuade Trump either to stick with the Iran nuclear deal or to reconsider his determination to impose tariff barriers on steel and aluminium imports has so far failed. Tariffs are the more urgent issue. The EU has already handed the WTO a list of goods from jeans to motorbikes that would be covered by any tit for tat trade restrictions. In less than 30 days, damaging tariffs could be in place. The UK exports around 7% of steel production and 3% of aluminium to the US. Last week, despite reservations by the international trade secretary Liam Fox, the government announced it would join any EU action. On Iran, the battle now is to protect EU companies from US sanctions. The UK, France and Germany have signed a joint letter demanding that European companies are spared from US sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). May, in her first face to face meeting with the world leaders who backed her by introducing diplomatic sanctions over the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury three months ago, will also want to restate her commitment to a rules-based international order, and her determination to prevent the normalisation of chemical weapons. She will also have the chance of a quiet word with both Angela Merkel the German Chancellor, and President Macron with little more than a fortnight to go before the EU summit. But the wider themes in Quebec are empowering women and girls and promoting a sustainable environment. May will call for a united front to press the industry to ensure women can use the web without fear of being subjected to online rape threats, harassment, cyberstalking, blackmail, vile comments and more. She wants the techniques now widely used to tackle online terrorist propaganda to be extended to end abuse targeted specifically at women and girls, in particular content promoting or depicting violence against women and girls, including illegal violent pornography and rape threats on social media platforms. May believes the UK has developed a pioneering legal framework to tackle online harms. The government is planning legislation on a mandatory social media code of practice, transparency reporting and online advertising. A white paper is due later this year. In remarks trailed in advance, the prime minister plans to say: \u201cWhat is illegal offline is illegal online and I am calling on world leaders to take serious action to deal with this, just like we are doing in the UK with our commitment to legislate on online harms such as cyberstalking and harassment.\u201d On World Oceans Day, Michael Gove, the environment secretary will also announce plans for increasing the number of marine conservation zones from 50 to 91. These will prevent activities such as dredging, or \u201csignificant\u201d onshore or offshore development and stop existing harmful activities. The new zones are intended to protected species such as the short snouted seahorse, stalked jellyfish and peacock\u2019s tail seaweed and a dozen other exotically-named marine creatures. In Canada, May will urge collective action to tackle \u201cthis shared environmental challenge\u201d. In her speech she will say: \u201cMarine plastics pollution is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world today. \u201cThe UK government is a world leader on this issue, with our 25 Year Environment Plan setting out a clear ambition to eliminate avoidable plastic waste to protect our rivers and seas. \u201cThere is an urgent need for greater global action and coordination on marine plastics pollution, including working with business, industry and non-governmental organisations to find innovative and effective solutions. \u201cThis is a global problem, requiring global solutions.\u201d",

This year\u2019s conclave, opening on Friday, is being referred to as the G6 plus one, or the G7 minus one. It promises to be a showdown between the US president and everyone else.

In reply, Trump asked, according to CNN: \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys burn down the White House?\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment and Canadian officials declined to comment on the record. The White House was burned by British troops in 1814 as part of a failed invasion of the mid-Atlantic, more than 50 years before the signing of Canada\u2019s confederation paved the way for the founding of modern-day Canada. Although the British successfully took Washington and burned much of the city, they failed in their major goal of taking Baltimore when their forces were rebuffed at the battle of Fort McHenry. Canada was a major battleground during the conflict \u2013 known as the war of 1812 \u2013 which played a significant part in the creation of the Canadian national identity.

But senior Republicans in Congress rejected the notion the US is headed toward a trade war. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wins a trade war. But we are not in a trade war,\u201d the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe are in a trade discussion to renegotiate Nafta.\u201d Canada\u2019s expressions of disappointment came as China warned that any trade dispute deals reached at talks in Beijing \u201cwill not take effect\u201d if Trump\u2019s threatened tariff hike on Chinese goods goes ahead. The statement came as Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, and China\u2019s top economic official, Vice-Premier Liu He, wrapped up a meeting on Beijing\u2019s pledge to narrow its trade surplus. Ross had said the delegations had discussed specific US exports China might purchase to ease the $337bn trade imbalance, but the talks ended with no joint statement and neither side released details. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2018. An earlier version described the US as having a $2bn surplus on steel \u201cwith the US\u201d.",
