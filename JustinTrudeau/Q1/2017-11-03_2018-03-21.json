Defence minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters that Canada would deploy two Chinook transport helicopters and four Griffon attack helicopters to provide armed escort and protection in the fight against Islamist militants in Mali. The 12-month deployment will also include an infantry unit and military trainers. A date for Canada\u2019s first deployment in Africa since its troubled mission to Rwanda in 1994 and the exact number of troops that will be sent have yet to be decided. The foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the unit heading to Mali would include female soldiers. \u201cOne of our priorities is to increase women\u2019s participation in peacekeeping,\u201d she said. The announcement is less ambitious than the Liberal government of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had initially planned. Shortly after coming to power in late 2015, Ottawa had indicated it would send up to 600 troops to Mali. Ministers later put the plans on hold amid fears of casualties, angering allies who said they felt let down, and prompting some to speculate the delay could hurt Canada\u2019s bid for a non-permanent seat at the UN security council. In recent months, jihadists have ramped up their activities in central Mali, targeting domestic and foreign forces in outbreaks of violence once confined to the country\u2019s north. Four UN peacekeepers were killed and four wounded in late February when a mine exploded under their vehicle in central Mali. The peacekeeping mission, known by the acronym Minusma, currently has 12,000 military personnel and 1,900 police. They have been deployed in Mali since 2013 to counter the jihadist insurgency and general lawlessness. The Canadians, according to Sajjan, will conduct reconnaissance, facilitate medical evacuations for the 57 UN partner nations already on the ground in Mali, and help plan missions in the country. James Bezan, defence spokesman for the official opposition Conservative party, accused the Liberals of sending troops to a highly dangerous country for partisan promises. \u201cThis is about Justin Trudeau\u2019s selfish political ambition to win a seat on the UN security council, and he is using our troops as political pawns,\u201d Bezan told reporters. Canada is running for one of the council\u2019s 10 non-permanent seats in an election that will take place in 2020.",

Special counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over all documents related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the New York Times has reported. It is the first known order directly related to Trump\u2019s business empire. Trump tweeted that he has had \u201cnothing to do with Russia \u2013 no deals, no loans, no nothing\u201d. The Democrats have alleged the future president\u2019s private company was \u201cactively negotiating\u201d a business deal in Moscow with a sanctioned Russian bank during the 2016 election campaign. It comes as the US accused Russia of a wide-ranging cyber assault on its energy grid and other key infrastructure, and stepped up sanctions on Russian intelligence for its interference in the 2016 elections. A trial of shark nets on the New South Wales north coast has caught just a single target shark in the past two months, while continuing to trap or kill dolphins, turtles, and protected marine life. A bull shark was caught in the nets around Ballina, while 55 other animals were either killed or trapped. Environmentalists said the data released on the nets, which span five beaches, was more evidence of their ineffectiveness. \u201cHow many more months of damning data will it take for government to finally realise this experiment is an utter failure, and shut it down?\u201d Humane Society International marine scientist Jessica Morris said. The US, UK, Germany and France have united to condemn the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter, issuing a rare joint statement deploring the \u201cassault on UK sovereignty\u201d. The unified comment from the four leaders follows extensive UK efforts to drum up international support for its response to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. The statement said the use of novichok \u201cconstitutes the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the second world war\u201d. The Coalition\u2019s espionage bill still threatens whistleblowers, bloggers, lawyers and people who innocently receive national security information, the Law Council of Australia has warned. Its president, Morry Bailes, will tell the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security at a hearing on Friday that further changes are needed so people who do not intend harm to national security are not punished. The lawyers\u2019 peak body joins the media union and the country\u2019s top media organisations in continuing to lobby for the bill to be dropped or significantly amended, despite the Turnbull government agreeing to a host of changes to protect public interest reporting. Sport Gareth Southgate has said he remains fully focused on preparing England for the World Cup, despite the political tensions between the UK and the tournament hosts Russia, and some calling for the England side to boycott the tournament. Max Rushden and co dissect Manchester United\u2019s and Chelsea\u2019s exit from the Champions League in the Football Weekly podcast, and in the last-chance saloon, Saints go for Mark Hughes. Thinking time A new documentary film on kangaroos is shocking and gruesome, but is its analysis sound asks Luke Buckmaster? We see emotive images of the animals majestically hopping across a sun-kissed landscape, contrasted with subsequent, horrific images of their body parts and mangled corpses. The makers of Kangaroo: A Love-Hate Story knew their documentary was going be controversial, just not this controversial. The film sometimes lacks rigorous analysis, such as suggesting kangaroos are endangered, but without backing this up with verifiable facts. Brigid Delaney thought she was getting away from it all on a trip to the Great Barrier Reef. And under the water was indeed an amazing experience. But above the surface she felt a familiar dread as a succession of people offered opinions and prejudices she profoundly disliked. The guide seemed to doubt bleaching on the reef, in the face of respectable scientific evidence; and other holidaymakers either were or sounded Islamophobic or homophobic. \u201cFor the third snorkel I threw myself off the side of the boat with a sort of depressed flop,\u201d she writes. \u201cWho were all these people with these horrible views? If the boat was representative of mainstream society ... then my Guardian colleague and I really were out on a limb.\u201d \u201cQuiet, lazy and gentle\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how Australia\u2019s first greyhound adoption cafe describes the former racing dogs that are looking for new homes. The cafe will serve the dual purpose of introducing people to greyhounds, and introducing foster greyhounds, who have often had minimal human contact, to a broad range of humans. About 2,700 greyhounds were adopted through a range of programs in 2016-17, but in the same period, 1,429 dogs \u2013 54% fewer than the previous year \u2013 were euthanised. Can this cafe find forever homes for these gentle pets? What\u2019s he done now? Trump has doubled down on his incorrect insistence that America has a trade deficit with Canada, leaving the Washington Post, among many others, to again call out his statement as a lie. He tweeted: \u201cWe do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn\u2019t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do\u2026they almost all do\u2026and that\u2019s how I know!\u201d It comes after he bragged that he made up facts in a meeting with Trudeau. Media roundup The Hobart Mercury reports that Tasmania\u2019s new House of Assembly will be the first Australian state parliament to have a female majority. The Age and Herald focus on Indonesian president Joko Widodo\u2019s support for the idea of Australia joining the Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean. At the Conversation, Michelle Grattan says Bill Shorten has scored own goals on tax and Adani as the Batman byelection looms. Coming up Malcolm Turnbull will meet the Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Asean-Australia summit in Sydney. The two are due to hold a joint press conference later on Friday. The Cambodian community will protest at Hyde Park in Sydney at 6pm against the visit of Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen. Cambodia\u2019s democracy has been crippled with the country\u2019s main opposition party dissolved last year and the opposition leader jailed. Independent news outlets have also been shut down. Hun Sen recently vowed to beat up protesters if they burned effigies of him.

          "bodyText": "Newsflash: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has urged countries to avoid being sucked into a global trade war in the wake of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. In a new blogpost, Lagarde calls for a multilateral approach to trade disagreements, and warns that no-one can win a trade war (That looks like a rebuttal of Donald Trump\u2019s claim that they\u2019re easy to win). Lagarde writes: \u201cPolicy makers need to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and resolve trade disagreements\u201d without resorting to such tactics, \u201cThey should ensure that the recently announced U.S. import tariffs do not lead to a wider escalation of protectionist measures. Economic history clearly shows that trade wars not only hurt global growth, but they are also unwinnable.\u201d Time for a recap Donald Trump\u2019s new top economic advisor has called for a \u201ctrade coalition of the willing\u201d of allies to work with America to tackle China over trade. Larry Kudlow argues that Beijing deserves a \u2018tough response\u2019 - a sign that the White House isn\u2019t ending its protectionist push. China has hit back, with a government official warning that \u2018appeasement\u2019 was not an option if Washington unleashed more tariffs. A Chinese state-owned tabloid newspaper also called the US out, saying it should make Americans \u201cmore hard-working\u201d. Germany has weighed in too; its economy ministry fears \u2018tangible\u2019 damage to the global economy Worries over tariffs have helped to push the aluminum price down to a three-month low today. Stocks, though, have managed a small rise -- the Dow is up, after three daily drops in a row. Financial analysts have warned that a trade war would hurt the markets, and send investors diving out of riskier assets. Donald Trump has revealed that he pretended the US had a trade deficit with Canada when he met Justin Trudeau recently. On the economic front, the number of American\u2019s filing new claims for jobless benefit has dropped. I\u2019ll be back later with any major developments.... The aluminum price has hit a three-month low today, suggesting that the new US tariffs are beginning to bite. The cost of a tonne of aluminum fell to $2,085 per tonne, its lowest level since before Christmas 2017. President Trump\u2019s decision to put a 10% tariffs on aluminum imports (excluding Canada and Mexico), is one factor; Norbert Ruecker of Julius Baer points out that they will hit demand: \u201cIf you look at the impact, the trade tariffs will, in the end, be deflationary globally,\u201d. The president is defending himself over today\u2019s story that he challenged Canada\u2019s prime minister over trade without knowing the facts (see earlier post). But....as Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McKee points out - the US government\u2019s own trade offices says it runs a surplus! Worries over trade wars seem to be hitting Boeing again. Shares in the aircraft maker are down almost 1.7% in early trading, making it the worst performer on the Dow. That\u2019s despite reports that Boeing could scoop a major new order, to supply fighter jets to India. Ding Ding: The New York stock exchange has rung the opening bell, and investor are trying to break a three-day losing streak. The Dow has opened higher, gaining 80 points of 0.3%. Traders are encouraged by today\u2019s strong US jobless figures. Energy stocks and financial firms are leading the way, with JP Morgan up 0.4% Some experts are relieved that Donald Trump has chosen Larry Kudlow as his new top economic adviser. One alternative was Peter Navarro, who helped craft Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy. He\u2019s a big supporter of tariffs, and a vocal critic of free trade - arguing that America is getting a rough deal as its intellectual property is snaffled by China. In contrast to Navarro, Kudlow is a more reassuring choice for the markets. Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen told clients: \u201cMarkets may actually find some comfort in the fact that Mr. Trump decided to give the job to Kudlow, rather than someone with more radical economic beliefs, such as Peter Navarro, who is even more skeptical about the current free trade paradigm. Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, dubbed Kudlow a \u201ccheerleader for growth\u201d, adding: \u201cHe regularly says \u2018Free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity.\u2019 He is a forceful advocate for open markets and trade liberalization, and more generally an economic libertarian who favors low taxes and less regulation.\u201d A dream candidate for Wall Street, in other words. But there is still jitteriness, simply because president Trump will be the one making the big calls on whether to slap fresh tariffs on Chinese technology imports, or European cars. Donald Trump should be cheered by the latest drop in US unemployment claims, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at trading firm UFX.com: \u201cThe US employment market has remained on a steady course of late, and with the latest figures showing a further fall in initial claimants, Donald Trump will surely use the opportunity to champion his job-boosting credentials as he embarks on the formative stages of a re-election campaign. \u201cA robust jobs market was a key pillar in his road to the White House and although there may be some who argue the success has come on the back of a healthier international economy, it\u2019s hard to argue with the results. Newsflash: The latest US unemployment figures show that America\u2019s labor market remains pretty strong. Just 226,000 Americans signed on for unemployment benefits last week, down from 230,000 in the previous seven days. That\u2019s close to the 48-year low struck in late February. It\u2019s also the 158th month in a row in which the \u2018initial claims\u2019 figure has come in below 300,000 -- traditionally the threshold for a robust jobs market. Wall Street analysts fear that Boeing could be a major victim from a trade war. Shares in the airline have fallen by over 8% this month, as tensions over president Trump\u2019s protectionist leanings have intensified. China is a key market for Boeing, which secured a $37bn deal to sell 300 planes to China Aviation Suppliers last November. Larry Kudlow\u2019s plan to build a coalition to force China to change its trade policies could put future such deals in doubt, if relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorate. As Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, put it to CNBC: \u201cThe question is really not economic. It\u2019s political at this point.\u201d China has pushed back against the criticism from Donald Trump and Larry Kudlow. With fresh tariffs looming, Beijing argues that America needs to work harder if it wants to close its whopping trade gap. Chinese officials are also warning that they will hit back, if America presses on with unilateral tariffs [Trump wants to cut the US-China trade deficit by $100bn]. Reuters has the details: In a Thursday editorial, widely-read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said the United States was trying to play the victim. \u201cIf the U.S. wants to reduce its trade deficit, it has to make Americans more hard-working and conduct reforms in accordance with international market demand, instead of asking the rest of the world to change. \u201cOnce a trade war starts, capable countries won\u2019t bow to the U.S. China has tried hard to avoid a trade war, but if one breaks out, appeasement is not an option.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said history showed that trade wars are in nobody\u2019s interests, but that China would protect its legitimate rights if \u201csomething happens we don\u2019t want to see\u201d. Ever the early riser, president Trump has just tweeted that America can look forward to years of \u2018fair trade\u2019. He\u2019s also confirmed Larry Kudlow\u2019s appointment to lead his National Economic Council. A profit warning from soapmaker PZ Cussons has taken the shine off the mood in the City today. Shares in PZ Cussons, which makes Imperial Leather soap and Original Source shower gel, tumbled by 15% as traders made a clean exit from the company. It admitted that earnings will miss forecasts, claiming that British consumers were cutting back on washing products. The UK washing and bathing division has continued to experience lower levels of purchases reflecting consumer caution across all retail channels caused by economic uncertainty and inflation out-stripping wage growth. This has also hit other consumer goods makers, with Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser both down around 1.5%. Across the markets, the European stocks markets are a little higher, but trade war worries abound. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE started the day higher, although there appeared little for traders to cheers. Sentiment remained downbeat as concerns of an all out trade war weighed, particularly in light of the Team which Trump is building at the White House, which is pointing to the more aggressively interventionist as far as foreign policy goes. Added to the concerns over Trumps newly formed team, reports that the President is looking to slap tariffs on $60 million worth of imports from China, no longer just steel and aluminium, is unnerving investors. Germany is increasingly worried that a global trade war could break out, hurting its growth and the wider global economy. In a new monthly report, the German economy ministry warns that the new US tariffs on some metal imports could cause uncertainty, and hurt trade. The ministry points out that the global economy is strengthening, but fears that protectionism could scupper this progress. It says: For the global economy, the IMF and, more recently, the OECD for the years 2018 and 2019 now expect growth of 3.9% each. However, this does not take into account the recently introduced US tariffs on steel and aluminum. These could significantly affect trade in some regions. However, the impact on the global economy as a whole should remain manageable. However, a possible escalation of a trade war and increasing uncertainty among market participants could cause tangible damage. It\u2019s important to note that Unilever isn\u2019t quitting its impressive headquarters at Blackfriars. Some staff will move to the new corporate HQ in Rotterdam. However, the company - dubbed Uni-leaver by some wags on social media - says its 7,300 UK-based employees won\u2019t be affected by the change. Even so, legal blogger David Allen Green is struck by the symbolism: The London Mayor\u2019s office are gutted that Unilever has chosen the Netherlands over Britain as its single legal base. Rajesh Agrawal, deputy mayor for business, argues that it shows the importance of keeping close ties with the EU after Brexit (even though Unilever insist Brexit wasn\u2019t a factor): Agrawal says: \u201cUnilever\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to the Netherlands is clearly disappointing news for the capital. It brings into sharp focus the need for the Government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe\u2019s leading business centre. The best way to do this is for London and the UK to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union.\u201d The big news in the City this morning is that Unilever has chosen Rotterdam over London as the site of its new corporate base, ending its dual-HQ structure. After weeks of speculation, the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant plumped for the Netherlands over the UK. It is insisting that Brexit isn\u2019t to blame, and there won\u2019t be job losses, but the decision is a blow to the City\u2019s prestige. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant, has picked Rotterdam over London as its main base in a move seen as a blow to the government in the wake of the Brexit vote. The group, which makes a number of well-known consumer brands including Persil, Dove and Marmite, has been based in London and Rotterdam for nearly a century. The Unilever chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, insisted Brexit \u201cwas absolutely not a factor\u201d in the decision, which was announced after a board meeting and a year-long review. Here\u2019s her full story: The Daily Mail think Unilever is trying to protect itself from a hostile takeover, having fought off Kraft Heinz last year. Overnight, Donald Trump gave a worrying insight into his negotiating approach with other world leaders. Speaking to donors at a fundraiser in Missouri, Trump bragged about how he\u2019d argued with Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau over trade - without actually knowing the facts. The Washington Post has the story: President Trump boasted in a fundraising speech Wednesday that he made up information in a meeting with the leader of a top U.S. ally, saying he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the United States runs a trade deficit with its neighbor to the north without knowing whether that was the case. \u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau, according to audio obtained by The Washington Post. \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. \u2026 And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, in that case, I feel differently,\u2019 I said, \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u2018Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 Trump\u2019s punchline is that America does run a trade deficit with Canada (as he claimed). However, US trade data actually shows a $12.5bn surplus (a $25bn surplus in services, minus a $12.5bn deficit in goods). Here\u2019s the full story: In fundraising speech, Trump says he made up trade claim in meeting with Justin Trudeau My colleague Ed Helmore has written a profile on Larry Kudlow. It covers his time working with Ronald Reagan in the 80s to his rehabilitation after being fired from Wall Street firm Bear Stearns over his cocaine addiction. Mazen Issa, senior foreign exchange strategist at TD Securities, says investors are concerned about Donald Trump\u2019s next move: \u201cThe Trump administration is rumoured to be preparing another tariff, this time aimed at China\u201d \u201cTaken in conjunction with speculation of additional cabinet reshuffles, broader risk sentiment could be vulnerable.\u201d Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM warns that trade wars are bad for growth: With Wall Street pummelled by rising fears of U.S protectionism on Wednesday, U.S stocks are at risk of extending losses this afternoon if the negative sentiment prevails. Risk aversion could become a dominant market theme moving forward, as concerns intensify over escalating trade tensions negatively impacting global growth. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets wonders if Kudlow and Trump will get along like a house on fire: Concern that the US administration was looking to widen the scope of tariffs to Chinese goods to the tune of $60bn weighed on investors\u2019 appetite for risk, though the declines were fairly moderate. This may have been down to the appointment of Larry Kudlow as President Trump\u2019s new economic adviser, who has stated that he is not a big fan of blanket tariffs, which should make for an interesting discussion with his new boss. America\u2019 Dow Jones index shed 1% last night, with Boeing dropping 2.5% amid worries about an escalating trade spat. Asian markets have been mixed today; Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 has dropped by 0.25%, India has dipped a little, while the Philippines index has shed almost 2%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The prospect of a protectionist trade war between the world\u2019s major economics continues to loom over the markets today. Donald Trump\u2019s new economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has intensified the pressure by claiming that Beijing hasn\u2019t played by the rules - and needs reining in. Kudlow was named as the new director of the National Economic Council on Wednesday, and promptly went on the air to tell China to expect a tough approach. He told CBNC that: \u201cI must say as somebody who doesn\u2019t like tariffs, I think China has earned a tough response not only from the United States... \u201cA thought that I have is the United States could lead a coalition of large trading partners and allies against China, or to let China know that they\u2019re breaking the rules left and right,\u201d . That\u2019s the way I\u2019d like to see. You call it a sort of a trade coalition of the willing.\u201d [that\u2019s a reference to George Bush\u2019s 2003 Iraq War coalition...] This has done little to assuage concerns that Trump will soon launch new tariffs on Chinese imports, such as technology and telecommunications products. Kudlow (a former Reagan advisor and Wall Street economist), has criticised tariffs in the past. But he\u2019s happy to back Trump\u2019s new steel and aluminium tariffs. He told CNBC that he was relieved that Trump had exempted Canada and Mexico, and perhaps Australia. Europe might also qualify for an exemption too, he hinted, if they cut some of the tariffs they impose on US goods. I don\u2019t like blanket tariffs and I don\u2019t think you should punish your friends to try and punish your enemies in international affairs. My problem is the principle of the thing, I just don\u2019t like blanket tariffs. Otherwise, the agenda is a little quiet, but there is some US economic data later: The agenda 12.30pm: US Empire Manufacturing survey 12.30pm: US weekly jobless figures",

Interest rates, even when pushed higher in the weeks and months ahead, will not cause postponement of discretionary purchases as long as income continues to rise near its present pace. Personal tax cuts are crucial to spur additional spending, but unlike prior cuts that had an immediate positive impact, this tax cut has not generated universal support across partisan lines.

European aluminium exports to the US, in view of both their quantity and characteristics, do not pose any threat to US national security.</p> <p>\u201cMost importantly, this blanket tariff does not address the root cause of the main challenges faced by the aluminium industry today: the unsustainable and steady increase of aluminium overcapacities in China.</p> <p>\u201cThis global challenge can only be managed effectively through a global and long-term solution based on multilateral rules and common enforcement such as the creation of a Global Aluminium Forum within G20,\u201d commented Gerd G\u00f6tz, Director General of European Aluminium.</p> <p>These unprecedented measures threaten to destabilize global trade flows. As a result of the tariff, European Aluminium fears a disruption of the current trading relationship between the United States and Europe, which have strongly interlinked value chains and a significant number of multinationals operating in both territories. The association also expects that the measures will likely result in a redirection of aluminium products from third countries to Europe. Decisive actions must be taken to neutralise effects on European companies.</p> <p>\u201cThe European value chain is already under enormous pressure due to global overcapacities, the announced measures put thousands of jobs in over 600 plants, many of which are SME\u2019s, in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden and Central and East European countries at risk.

The broader market sold off as these tariffs are creating and uncertain environment trade wise and the market hates any interventionist policy from governments.

          "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our latest news story on the growing fears of a global trade war: Europe has warned Donald Trump to expect retaliatory strikes against American icons like Harley-Davidson, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon, if he sparks a trade war by going ahead with punitive US tariffs on foreign steel. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warned there would be consequences for the US if Trump\u2019s threat of a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports takes effect. \u201cIf the Americans impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, then we must treat American products the same way,\u201d Juncker told German television stations. \u201cWe must show that we can also take measures. This cannot be a unilateral transatlantic action by the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have to shoot back, but we must take action. \u201cWe will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans \u2013 Levi\u2019s,\u201d he added. His warning came as the International Monetary Fund said that Donald Trump\u2019s plan would cause international damage \u2013 and also harm America\u2019s own economy. \u201cThe import restrictions announced by the US President are likely to cause damage not only outside the US, but also to the US economy itself, including to its manufacturing and construction sectors, which are major users of aluminium and steel,\u201d the IMF said. Other world leaders also threatened retaliation. Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said US tariffs would be \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d and China too expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over the plans. Meanwhile, the US president breezily asserted that \u201ctrade wars are good\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Ed Conway of Sky News says the criticism of president Trump\u2019s plans from the IMF is significant: Marketwatch points out that Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to impose new tariffs went down well with one audience -- the US steel and aluminum producers. The American Iron and Steel Institute said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with the tariffs announcement, while the Aluminum Association said \u201cwe appreciate\u201d the president\u2019s commitment to help the aluminum industry. Ding ding goes the Wall Street closing bell. As traders catch their breath after another busy week, the Dow Jones industrial average is down almost 71 points, or 0.3%, at 24,538. That\u2019s a recovery on its earlier losses, but also the fourth daily drop in a row. Big fallers on the Dow included McDonald\u2019s (-4.6%), Caterpillar (-2.3%) and Boeing (-1.1%). The S&amp;P 500, which contains more companies than the Dow, ended up 0.5%. Wall Street is staging a late recovery! In the last few minutes of trading, the Dow is bouncing back from its lows, and the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are now up for the day.... Here\u2019s a reminder that Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico will take the biggest hit from new steel tariffs: Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics suggests the new steel tariffs could scupper the hopes of the US rejoining the NAFTA trade bloc: Canada is mulling its own response to the threat of tariffs on its steel and aluminum sales to the US. As we reported earlier, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said such a move was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. A government source has now told Reuters that Ottawa is considering what sanctions it could impose in retaliation. Canada is taking nothing for granted, the source added -- another sign that a trade war could break out.... With 45 minutes to go, the Dow is down 222 points, or 0.9%, and heading for a weekly loss. The vice-president of the European Commission, Jyrki Katainen, has warned that Trump\u2019s new tariffs could trigger a global trade war. Katainen, who is also the former prime minister of Finland, points out that protectionism helped to create the Great Depression of the 1930s. Within Europe, Germany could take the biggest hit from Trump\u2019s new tariffs. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the biggest EU-based exporter of steel to the US: EU countries will also worry that steel will be redirected to them, instead of going to America. An influx of extra imports could hurt their domestic industry (although also deliver cheaper prices to consumers) Business Insider have crunched the latest trade figures to show that Canada would take the biggest hit from the tariffs announced on Thursday: Just in: The governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, has called on Donald Trump to reconsider his decision on steel and aluminum tariffs. He warns that US companies which use steel could be driven abroad, costing Americans their jobs. Here\u2019s our news story on Wilbur Ross\u2019s comments (complete with that tin of soup).... It\u2019s also emerged today that Carl Icahn, a former special adviser to Donald Trump, sold $31.3m of shares in a company heavily dependent on steel imports last week. That was good timing by Icahn - as shares in Manitowoc have fallen sharply since the tariffs were announced. More here: NBC are reporting that Donald Trump announced his plans for steel and aluminum tariffs without any internal review by government lawyers or his own staff. Officials are also claiming that the president was \u2018gunning for a fight\u2019 when he made the decision. It came during a tough week at the White House (including son-in-law Jared Kushner having his security clearance downgraded, and communications director Hope Hicks deciding to step down). NBC says: According to two officials, Trump\u2019s decision to launch a potential trade war was born out of anger at other simmering issues and the result of a broken internal process that has failed to deliver him consensus views that represent the best advice of his team. On Wednesday evening, the president became \u201cunglued,\u201d in the words of one official familiar with the president\u2019s state of mind. A quick market update: The Dow Jones is still wallowing in the red, and currently down 241 points or 1% at 24,367. That follows those hefty losses in Europe today. Caterpillar, the construction and machinery giant, has lost 2% while aeroplane maker Boeing is down 1.6%. They\u2019d both suffer from higher metals prices, and a slowdown in global growth. The broader S&amp;P 500 is slightly down, while the Nasdaq is flat. Newsflash: The International Monetary Fund is pleading with Donald Trump not to trigger a trade war. As tensions with Europe rise, fast, the IMF is calling on all sides to work together, rather than descend into protectionism. It fears that these new tariffs would hurt the US economy, as well as other countries. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice says: \u201cThe import restrictions announced by the U.S. President are likely to cause damage not only outside the U.S., but also to the U.S. economy itself, including to its manufacturing and construction sectors, which are major users of aluminum and steel. We are concerned that the measures proposed by the U.S. will, de facto, expand the circumstances where countries use the national-security rationale to justify broad-based import restrictions. We encourage the U.S and its trading partners to work constructively together to reduce trade barriers and to resolve trade disagreements without resort to such emergency measures.\u201d Here\u2019s the full quote from Jean-Claude Juncker, threatening to hit back against America with new tariffs on sales into Europe: \u201cWe will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson, on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levi\u2019s. \u201cWe are here and they will get to know us. We would like a reasonable relationship to the United States, but we cannot simply put our head in the sand.\u201d The EC president was speaking on German TV (via Reuters). Boom!: Europe is threatening to hit back against America, with new tariffs on some famous US names. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, has told reporters that tariffs could be imposed on Harley-Davidson motor bikes, bourbon whiskey and Levi\u2019s jeans. That ratchets up the tensions between the two sides. EC spokewoman Mina Andreeva has tweeted the details: Duncan Robinson of the Economist says it could hit some consumers hard: Wilbur Ross has also confirmed that Trump\u2019s tariffs will be applied globally. That dashes hopes that UK and other European manufacturers might be exempt, and raises the chances of retaliatory action by the EU. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, the commerce secretary explained the president\u2019s thinking: \u201cOf the options that I presented, the president chose one -- which was put broad tariffs on all products from all countries. \u201cWe have to deal with a global problem on a global basis\u201d to stamp out \u201cthis recurring phenomenon\u201d of shipments going through other nations to evade tariffs. President Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, reckons people are over-reacting. He appeared on CNBC earlier this afternoon, to argue that consumers wouldn\u2019t notice any impact from higher steel and aluminium tariffs. In a surprising twist, Ross even produced a soup can to back up his case, saying: \u201cIn a can of Campbell\u2019s Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of 1 cent on the price on a can of Campbell\u2019s soup. I just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201d Only one problem; a Campbell\u2019s spokesperson had earlier warned that new tariffs on imported tin plate steel would indeed push up prices.... More here Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said US tariffs on steel and aluminium would be \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. He added that he had made this point directly to Trump, and said his officials would continue to engage with all levels of the US government in the coming days. The threat of a trade war in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminium has rattled stock markets, which had already reverted to their volatile ways of a couple of weeks ago. But Trump is not the only concern for European markets, of course. Investors were also nervous ahead of Sunday\u2019s Italian election and the vote in Germany on the same day by members of the SDP party about whether to join a coalition government. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 hit its lowest level since December 2016 as, with all the other worries, investors also had Theresa May\u2019s key Brexit speech to deal with. It is safe to say they were not exactly inspired by the prime minister\u2019s words. Dave Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: We have heard much of it before, and there wasn\u2019t much for traders to latch on to. Mrs May made it clear the UK would like a deal that is geared to its unique needs. The PM once again stated that \u2018no deal was better than a bad deal\u2019, which could prove to be costly. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 105.74 points or 1.47% lower at 7069.90 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.27% to 11,913.71 France\u2019s Cac closed down 2.39% at 5136.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.39% to 21,912.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.13% at 9531.1 In Greece, the Athens market lost 2.16% to 813.09 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down 150 points or 0.6%. The World Trade Organisation has said a trade war is in no one\u2019s interests. In a statement WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said: The WTO is clearly concerned at the announcement of US plans for tariffs on steel and aluminium. The potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial response of others. A trade war is in no one\u2019s interests. The WTO will be watching the situation very closely. More on possible EU retaliation, courtesy Reuters: The market falls are continuing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 1.3%, the FTSE 100 has fallen 1.4% and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.3%. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The selling continues apace across markets this afternoon, with the phrase \u2018sea of red\u2019 getting an outing once more. It is indeed a \u2018risk-off\u2019 afternoon in the old-fashioned sense of the term, with gold being furiously bought as risk assets are dumped unceremoniously overboard. Tariffs do not go down well, it seems. European markets, with their heavy concentrations of industrial stocks, are suffering a double whammy of US tariff concerns and the return of their old foe, a stronger euro. In London the big news has been the speech from the Prime Minister. As ever, it has generated the usual variety of responses, but the aim of conciliatory approach from the UK runs through the text, emphasising the need for both to come together. Given it has been so heavily trailed there has been little market reaction, and the ball now lies in Brussels\u2019 court. While Friday harks back to the crisis days of market volatility, the weekend will resemble those of times past too, as markets wait for results from Germany and Italy. Both are important in their own way, and will help set the tone come Monday, although in the case of Italy maybe no government will be better than one committed to disrupting the established order? The Kremlin may be concerned about the proposed Trump tariffs but Russia\u2019s steel makers should be pretty much unaffected, Reuters is reporting: Russian metals and mining companies face relatively little harm from any introduction of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, analysts and company representatives said on Friday. Russia\u2019s top two steelmakers and its leading aluminium producer saw their share prices fall after President Donald Trump said he would impose hefty tariffs to protect U.S. producers... Russia shares Europe\u2019s concern about the decision, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, adding that Moscow is \u201ccarefully analysing the situation which is forming in trade relations after this statement\u201d. Russian deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich said he expected some damage to Russia from the new duties, Interfax news agency reported, but he added that any harm would be more significant for the European Union and China. Analysts also said the long-term impact for Russian steel and aluminium producers would be muted. For Severstal, a leading steel producer, and Rusal, the small size of their U.S. sales makes it easy to redirect to other markets, analysts said. The roughly 300,000 tonnes of steel that Severstal exports to the United States can easily be channelled elsewhere, BCS Global Markets experts said. This was echoed by company representatives, who told Reuters the United States accounted for just 2 percent of Severstal\u2019s sales, though the company\u2019s shares were down 2 percent. \u201cAs for aluminium, it is a virtually zero issue as Rusal sells only around 10 percent to 15 percent of volumes there and will send the material elsewhere at virtually no cost,\u201d BCS wrote in a note. Rusal, controlled by businessman Oleg Deripaska, saw its share price fall 3.3 percent. The company did not reply to a request for comment. Russian steelmakers with sizeable exports to the United States would be protected from the impact of tariffs by their U.S. assets, analysts said. Steel producer Evraz, co-owned by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, exports 0.4 million tonnes of steel slabs to the United States, but its North American assets sell 2.2 million tonnes on the U.S. market, VTB Capital analysts said. Domestic price rises would more than offset the new costs. More indications of a positive US economy, which in turn adds to the case for further interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve. US consumer confidence came in at a better than expected last month, according to the University of Michigan. Its consumer sentiment index rose from 95.7 in January to a final figure of 99.7, better than the expected 99,5 but just below the initial reading of 99.9. The rise came amid the stock market turmoil seen in February and before the latest trade war fears, but followed the Trump tax reforms. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: Consumer sentiment remained quite favorable in February, at its second highest level since 2004. Consumers based their optimism on favorable assessments of jobs, wages, and higher after-tax pay. The highest proportion of households since 1998 reported that their finances had improved compared with a year ago and anticipated continued gains during the year ahead. Economic news heard by consumers continued to be dominated by the tax reform legislation and net job gains, which was untarnished by the consensus view that interest rates would increase and stock prices would remain volatile. Although rising interest rates was seen as a reason to temper their longer term outlook for the overall economy, only a modest moderation in the pace of economic growth was anticipated. Although consumers expected the unemployment rate to dip below 4% in 2018, only modest wage growth was anticipated, and inflation expectations have remained unchanged. Interest rates, even when pushed higher in the weeks and months ahead, will not cause postponement of discretionary purchases as long as income continues to rise near its present pace. Personal tax cuts are crucial to spur additional spending, but unlike prior cuts that had an immediate positive impact, this tax cut has not generated universal support across partisan lines. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.9% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. A bit of historical context. The last time the US went big on protectionism it ended in the Great Depression. Here\u2019s a piece from my colleague Dominic Rushe from earlier in the year when Trump was also talking tough on trade : With no sign of recovery in stock markets Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Will we really see the start of a trade war? The truth is, the world relies on the US in one way or the other. Retaliation could only hurt the retaliator. So these warnings may not be backed up by action. In fact, there is even the small possibility that Trump may do a U-turn. However, Trump does seem to enjoy global confrontation and with mid-term elections fast approaching, he may press ahead as he aims to protect domestic companies from what he feels unfair trade arrangements. So, as we head into the weekend, sentiment towards both the stock markets and the dollar are clearly negative. The dollar is doing slightly better against commodity currencies, which tend to be move up and down with risk appetite changes. However, against the euro and in particular, the yen, a safe haven currency, the greenback looks rather weak. An economist\u2019s view of the Trump tariffs: The prospect of a trade war prompted by Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has unsurprisingly sent US markets sharply lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 322 points or 1.2% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite just over 1%. More from Trump, policy by tweet: European Aluminium, a Brussels based association representing more than 600 plants in 30 European countries, has called on the European Commission and the EU to protect the industry in the wake of Trump\u2019s tariff plans. It said: \u201cWe regret President Trump\u2019s decision to impose a tariff on all aluminium imports independent of their country of origin. European aluminium exports to the US, in view of both their quantity and characteristics, do not pose any threat to US national security. \u201cMost importantly, this blanket tariff does not address the root cause of the main challenges faced by the aluminium industry today: the unsustainable and steady increase of aluminium overcapacities in China. \u201cThis global challenge can only be managed effectively through a global and long-term solution based on multilateral rules and common enforcement such as the creation of a Global Aluminium Forum within G20,\u201d commented Gerd G\u00f6tz, Director General of European Aluminium. These unprecedented measures threaten to destabilize global trade flows. As a result of the tariff, European Aluminium fears a disruption of the current trading relationship between the United States and Europe, which have strongly interlinked value chains and a significant number of multinationals operating in both territories. The association also expects that the measures will likely result in a redirection of aluminium products from third countries to Europe. Decisive actions must be taken to neutralise effects on European companies. \u201cThe European value chain is already under enormous pressure due to global overcapacities, the announced measures put thousands of jobs in over 600 plants, many of which are SME\u2019s, in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden and Central and East European countries at risk. We urge the European Commission and EU Member States to implement without further delay actions to protect our industrial interests, in line with international trade rules\u201d concludes G\u00f6tz. Speaking of possible European retaliation, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said there would be a co-ordinated European response if the move went ahead. He told reporters all options were on the table and there would be a \u201cstrong, unilateral and co-ordinated\u201d response from the EU. He added: These unilateral measures are not acceptable. They would have a major impact on the European economy and French companies like Vallourec and Arecelor. [Quotes courtesy Reuters] Long gone are the days when Donald Trump hailed the spectacular performance of the stock market: The American Chambers of Commerce in the EU is also not happy with the President\u2019s tariff proposals: US government plans to impose tariffs and limits on imports of steel and aluminium on the basis of national security, authorised under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, would fail to appropriately address legitimate concerns regarding global overcapacity. It also risks a deterioration in transatlantic economic and political relations that could threaten jobs, investment and security on both sides of the Atlantic. The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU) shares the US government\u2019s concerns regarding global overcapacity of steel and aluminium, which can hurt domestic jobs in the EU and the US and encourage unfair trading practices. However, this decision would unfairly target European manufacturers and would not address Chinese excess capacity, the root cause of the issue. As referenced by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the decision could lead to retaliatory measures by the EU against US companies and also could contravene World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. American companies employ more than 4.7 million workers in Europe, with aggregate US investment totalling more than \u20ac2 trillion in 2017. Susan Danger, CEO, AmCham EU, said: \u201cAddressing global overcapacity of steel and aluminium requires coordinated action by the EU and the US. Unilateral US government actions would fail to address this issue and instead risk harming America\u2019s relationship with Europe, its staunchest ally.\u201d President Trump\u2019s planned tariffs may not actually take place, says Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. But if they do, there is likely to be retaliation. He says: Steel and aluminium account for about 2% of world trade, so the direct impact on the global economy of the tariffs President Trump announced yesterday would be minimal. But the fact that they are being justified under a flimsy pretext of national security increases the risks of retaliation. Will these tariffs actually be implemented? Not necessarily: after all, we are talking about Trump! He said he will sign the executive order next week, but there will doubtless be opposition from Congressional Republicans, US corporations and US allies. This, and the dip in the stock market, may cause Trump to change his mind. And it is possible that when the order is written it will allow exceptions for allies, such as Canada and Germany, who (unlike China!) are big sources of US steel imports.... Will other governments retaliate? Probably. Canada has said it would \u201ctake measures to protect its domestic trade interests and workers\u201d; Brazil has said the same; and the EU has reportedly discussed possible targets for retaliation. Other governments may also move to protect their own steel industries, which would be legal under WTO terms. That said, we suspect that any retaliation, from these countries and China, would be targeted and proportionate in order to try to prevent the problem escalating. What is the biggest risk? The real worry is that this marks a turning point in US trade policy, away from bluster and brinkmanship towards actual protectionist measures. We have consistently warned that this would become more likely as the mid-term and presidential elections approach. If so, President Trump may discover that, contrary to his tweet this morning, there are rarely any winners from trade wars. An influential member of the European Parliament has warned that Europe must retaliate if the US imposes tariffs on steel and aluminium. Manfred Weber, chairman of the EPP Group of centre-right MEPs, suggested that Europe would need to throw its forces into any trade war, saying: \u201cThe US President is playing a very dangerous game. A trade dispute is to the detriment of everyone. But if Donald Trump increases tariffs on European goods for no reason, then Europe must react. Priority must be given to protecting jobs in Europe. The EU has to show its strength.\u201d The Wall Street Journal has generally taken a more positive view of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency than rival newspapers (to the anger of some staff). But not on this occasion. Today, the WSJ editorial board have roasted the president\u2019s move on tariffs, saying it will hurt the US economy and weaken his own efforts. It begins: Donald Trump made the biggest policy blunder of his Presidency Thursday by announcing that next week he\u2019ll impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. This tax increase will punish American workers, invite retaliation that will harm U.S. exports, divide his political coalition at home, anger allies abroad, and undermine his tax and regulatory reforms. President Trump just sent another tweet, defending his tariffs (in the face of widespread criticism from home and abroad) If a trade war is really breaking out, then kitchen equipment maker Electrolux has just fired another shot - by threatening to pull investment in America. Reuters has the details: Sweden\u2019s Electrolux, Europe\u2019s largest home appliance maker, said on Friday it would put on hold a planned $250 million investment in the United States after President Donald Trump announced he would impose tariffs on imported aluminium and steel. \u201cWe are putting it on hold. We believe that tariffs could cause a pretty significant increase in the price of steel on the U.S. market,\u201d Electrolux spokesman Daniel Frykholm said. Economics professor Adam Posen has roundly blasted the idea of imposing fresh tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium into the US. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNBC the plan was \u201cjust straight up stupid,\u201d, adding: This is fundamentally incompetent, corrupt or misguided.\u201d Posen also took issue with President Trump\u2019s argument that he was protecting US jobs and industries, as: Steel is just a tiny input in the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 which is why it\u2019s so crazy. According to CNBC, there were roughly 140,000 Americans employed in steel mills in 2015, while 6.5 million Americans worked in industries that consumed steel. More here. The Mexican peso is sliding this morning, making it the worst-performing major currency against the US dollar. Trump\u2019s protectionist stance on trade wars and tariffs are undermining hopes that America could rejoin the NAFTA pact. The European Commission has warned it will impose countermeasures against America, if new tariffs are imposed on EU aluminium and steel. EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has vowed to \u2018react firmly\u2019 to president Trump\u2019s move, saying: \u201cInstead of providing a solution, this move can only aggravate matters. The EU has been a close security ally of the US for decades. We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk. The EU will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests. The Commission will bring forward in the next few days a proposal for WTO-compatible countermeasures against the US to rebalance the situation. Russia has also expressed concern over Donald Trump\u2019s plans. In a daily briefing with journalists, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow shares European capitals\u2019 concern with reports of the adoption of new steel and aluminium tariffs by the United States. \u201cThis situation deserves close attention,\u201d Peskov, who serves as a personal spokesman to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told journalists by phone. Peskov added: \u201cWe know that extreme concern has been expressed in many European capitals with these kinds of decisions. We share this concern and are carefully analysing the situation which is unfolding now in trade relations after this announcement.\u201d Stock markets are falling deeper into the red, following Donald Trump\u2019s declaration that America could easily win a trade war. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 73 points, or 1%, at 7101. That\u2019s a new three-week low. Mining companies are suffering from the prospect of protectionism - as demand for iron ore, coal, copper, oil and nickel would all weaken. Germany\u2019s DAX is still lurching around a six-month low. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says investors around the globe are worried: A negative vibe lingered across financial markets on Friday, after Donald Trump\u2019s vow to impose severe tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium sparked fears of a global trade war. In a move that dealt a blow to global sentiment, Trump said on Thursday that the United States would set tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminium. This bombshell development is likely to fuel concerns of retaliatory actions from major US trade partners consequently weighing on risk appetite. Investors are clearly jittery by the threat of a potential global trade war and its possible effect on stock markets. Wall Street is also expected to suffer falls when it opens in three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called down around 200 points, or 0.9%. That would add to yesterday\u2019s 420-point tumble. Newsflash: President Trump has tweeted that it will be easy for America to win a trade war: That\u2019s unlikely to calm nerves in the financial markets.... David Lowe, head of international trade at law firm Gowling WLG, predicts that president Trump could announce more protectionist policies in the weeks ahead. Lowe says: \u201cAll the figures suggest that the first year of any administration is the calm before the storm. The groundwork is done and the wind builds. Now Trump\u2019s first year is complete with the potential for the floodgates to open, it\u2019s safe to assume this may not be the only shock policy announcement.\u201d A recent report from Gowling found that the USA has the biggest protectionist stance across the world. Since 2009, it has made 1,085 more protectionist measures more than liberalising ones. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former head of Nato and ex-Danish prime minister, warns that tariffs will hurt a range of US businesses who use steel. He also fears that Europe could face pressure to become more protectionist too. Canada, Brazil and Russia will all be hit hard by new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into America, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. They say: The countries that will be hardest-hit by the tariff include some of the US\u2019s biggest trading partners. The commerce department reported that the biggest importers of steel in 2017 were (in descending order) Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Russia. China was 11th, supplying just 2% of the total. For aluminium, the biggest importers were Canada, Russia, China, the UAE and Bahrain. (China supplied 11% of the total.) The EIU also expect other countries to hit back: We expect other countries, notably China, to retaliate in kind. The tariffs are a particular snub to the Chinese government, which had sent its leading trade envoy, Liu He, to Washington to discuss the US-China relationship. Earlier this week, the EIU warned that a trade war would be a major threat to global stability. Yesterday\u2019s comments from Trump haven\u2019t changed that view... Bank of England Mark Carney is discussing cryptocurrencies now - there\u2019s a live feed here. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in a media interview that he was\u201cextremely concerned\u201d about Donald Trump\u2019s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum. \u201cA sweeping move against the rest of world by the US\u201d, Gabriel told the Funke group of newspapers, \u201cwould hit our exports and jobs amongst the hardest\u201d. Gabriel said: \u201cI hope that President Trump reconsiders his announcement. We need to do everything possible to avoid an international trade war.\u201d The president of the Federal Association of German Industry, Dieter Kempf, described America\u2019s \u201cpolicy of partition\u201d as a mistake, adding: \u201cUS president Donald Trump is risking a world-wide trade conflict and a spiral of protectionism that will end up also costing American jobs\u201d. President Trump\u2019s plan to slap tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has gone down badly with the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think-tank. Kate Andrews of the IEA it will hurt Americans: Mark Carney has also warned that Bitcoin looks like a bubble, and could have a \u2018pretty brutal reckoning\u2019 Breaking: Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has suggested greater regulatory controls over cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. He has labelled them as \u201c inherently risky\u201d and that they are \u201cfailing\u201d to fulfil their most basic function as money. Carney say governments should \u201cregulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system.\u201d He said Threadneedle Street was currently considering the risks posed to UK financial stability by bitcoin and other digital currencies, and that the Bank would report to the G20 in Argentina later this month. At present, cryptocurrencies \u201cdo not appear to pose material risks to financial stability\u201d, says Carney, but that they \u201ccould rise\u201d in future as more people begin to use them. Speaking in London because the snow stopped him from reaching Edinburgh to deliver a speech at the inaugural Scottish Economics Conference, he said cryptocurrencies were failing to meet the key tests of money set by the 18th Century Scottish economist Adam Smith - the father of modern capitalism. \u201cCryptocurrencies act as money at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users. According to the governor, bitcoin has been too volatile to act as a store of value - failing a major test set of currencies - while he also said it was an inefficient means of exchange as no major high street retailers accept the digital currency. Roy Rickhuss, the head of the Community union, fears that jobs will be lost in the UK and the US if these tariffs are imposed. Conservative MP Simon Clarke is also very concerned about the impact on Britain\u2019s steel industry: Clarke, who represents Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, is also vice chairman of the of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Steel. Back to tariffs.... and British unions are very alarmed by the prospect of America imposing swingeing costs on steel and aluminium imports. Richard Warren, head of policy at UK Steel, fears that president Trump will impose \u2018blanket measures\u2019 on all steel imports, regardless of their origin. Warren says this would be an \u201cextremely blunt\u201d way of tackling the problem of overcapacity in the global steel industry. This requires a coordinated global approach. Whilst we all too well understand the frustrations of the US sector, measures such as these smack of short-termism, protectionism and would be rife with unintended consequences for global trade and for the users of steel in the US. \u201cAt a UK level, our sector exports some \u00a3360 million worth of high-value steel products into the US each year, almost 15% of our exports. These measures, would seriously undermine our ability to compete in this market. Equally there is significant apprehension about the indirect impacts of these measures in the form of steel trade diverted away from the US to other markets, such as the UK. In short, these measures would cause serious damage to the prospects of many steel producers here. UK Steel is urging Theresa May to push for \u201ca robust response from the EU\u201d, adding: \u201cIf next week\u2019s official announcement does reveal the worst, there is a strong message here for the UK Government as well. In its imagined post-Brexit role as the vanguard for global free trade, it must remember that not everyone is on the same page and not everyone is playing by the same rules. Whilst we have to resist any urge to mirror such protectionist moves, we must at the same time be clear-eyed and equip ourselves with tools to respond effectively and protect our interests when necessary.\u201d Newsflash: Activity across Britain\u2019s building sector picked up last month, but remains weak. Data firm Markit reports that commercial construction strengthened in February, but civil construction and housebuilding was weaker. Builders reported that new work decreased for the second month running, while total business activity increased only marginally. Markit says: Anecdotal evidence suggested that fragile business confidence and ongoing political uncertainty remained key factors holding back client demand. This pushed the monthly construction PMI, which measures activity, up to 51.4 from 50.2 (which was close to stagnation). In other news, the Weinstein Company has been saved from bankruptcy. The firm, co-founded by disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein, is being acquired by an investment team led by billionaire Ron Burkle and Maria Contreras-Sweet, the former head of President Obama\u2019s Small Business Administration. It had been expected to fold, after talks with Burkle and Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group had hit deadlock. Contreras-Sweet says the move will save 150 jobs, protect the small businesses who are owed money and create a victims\u2019 compensation fund for those who suffered from the sexual harassment scandal. Newsflash: Germany\u2019s main stock index, the Dax, has hit a six-month low. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel has said he\u2019s \u2018very concerned\u2019 by Donald Trump\u2019s move, and called on the EU to respond decisively. Speaking to German media, Gabriel says he hopes Trump will reconsider the tariffs announced last night. China has expressed \u201cgrave concern\u201d over US plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, with the move likely to hurt US allies as well as Chinese producers. Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that the US will impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium next week sent stock markets around the world tumbling and could prompt other countries to take action. The Chinese side expresses grave concern,\u201d the ministry of commerce said. The statement did not mention any retaliatory steps but encouraged Washington to solve disputes through negotiation. Chinese officials have previously said they would take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to defend national interests. Australia\u2019s government is already scrambling to protect its manufacturers from the impact of new tariffs on steel and aluminium. It is \u201curgently lobbying the Trump administration for an exemption\u201d to the move, according to the AAP newswire. Here\u2019s more details: Federal Trade Minister Steve Ciobo labelled the decision, which comes a week after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull raised the issue with the president in Washington DC, \u201cdisappointing\u201d. \u201cThe imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney on Friday. The government is concerned retaliatory measures by other major economies could trigger a slowdown in the global economy. \u201cThat is in no one\u2019s interest,\u201d Mr Ciobo said. History shows that trade wars aren\u2019t good for stocks - and encourage nervous investors to pile into safe-haven government debt instead. European steelmakers are being hit this morning, with ArcelorMittal\u2019s shares down 2%. Across the markets, the industrials sector has lost 1% while basic materials is down 0.9%. Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has hit its lowest level since 12 February, as worries of a trade war sweep through the City. The FTSE 100 shed 42 points, or over 0.5%, at the start of trading in London. Mining companies are among the fallers, as investors calculate that slapping tariffs on steel and aluminium could hit demand for commodities. Other European indices are also falling in early trading; Germany\u2019s DAX has lost 1% and France\u2019s CAC has shed 0.75% as traders worry about the implications of Trump\u2019s move. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says: The negative open follows a sharply lower close on Wall St that flowed into Asia overnight after President Trump sparked concerns of a protectionist trade war with China and the EU by announcing his intention to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminium. Several experts have warned that Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could trigger retaliatory action, and even a full-blown trade war: Robert Carnell of ING \u201cThe world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminium... this is how recessions start. \u201cTrade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on - more is better.\u201d Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada As had been foreshadowed yesterday, President Trump announced new tariffs on Steel (25%) and aluminium (10%) imports late yesterday. Many of the US\u2019s main trading partners have said they will respond with reciprocal action. Generally, restrictions on world trade would be less negative for relatively closed economies, like the US, and hence positive for USD. But the risk of a bilateral trade war with China makes the current situation different, given China\u2019s large holdings of USTs. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group Under the pretext of national security, Trump has announced tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. However, it still remains unclear whether this will be applied to imports from all countries or just some. Whilst one of Trump\u2019s aims is to encourage China to reform its practises, the reality is that Canada and Brazil are bigger exporters to the US than China. Whilst market eyes have been firmly on interest rate expectations and recent volatility, no one was preparing for a potential trade war. The broader market sold off as these tariffs are creating and uncertain environment trade wise and the market hates any interventionist policy from governments. Whilst US steelmakers and aluminium makers rallied hard following the announcement, the Dow closed 430 points lower, whilst the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The markets are taking a hammering this morning after Donald Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium. The US president announced plans to impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel, and 10% on aluminium \u201cfor \u201ca long period of time\u201d. In another example of his America First agenda, Trump told metal industry bosses that: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have protection for the first time in a long time.\u201d We don\u2019t have full details of the plan yet. But the broad-brush announcement has triggered fears of retaliatory action from other countries, notably China. A trade war could slow global trade, undermine globalisation, hurt economic growth and push up costs. Wall Street reacted swiftly last night, sending the Dow Jones down 420 points. Asia has been hit too, and European markets are dropping in early trading (more on that shortly). As my colleague Dominic Rushe reports: The Nikkei index in Japan fell 2.4%, Hong Kong and South Korea were down 1.6%, and the ASX200 in Sydney was off 1% in early afternoon trading. Asian steelmakers bore the brunt. South Korea\u2019s Posco fell 3% and Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel 4%. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney said it was a \u201csharp reminder of the initial negative reaction to the election of Mr Trump ... An explanation may come, but the initial market interpretation of the move is rank populism. The lack of structure makes anticipating further measures and possible responses to retaliatory moves difficult to predict.\u201d Also coming up today We find out how Britain\u2019s building sector fared in February, when Markit releases its monthly construction PMI. Traders will be watching the pound closely, as Theresa May gives a big speech on Brexit. The PM is expected to urge both sides of the Brexit debate to reunite for the good of the country.... There may be some disappointed faces in Edinburgh. Bank of England governor Mark Carney had been due to address the inaugural Scottish Economics Conference in person - but due to the snow, he\u2019ll scrapped the trip and will speak by video link. We also discover how Canada\u2019s economy fared in the last three months of 2017. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for February 10am GMT: Mark Carney speaks to the Inaugural Scottish Economics Conference. 1.30pm GMT: Canadian GDP 1.30pm: Theresa May\u2019s Brexit speech",

          "body": "<p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, normally gets love-bombed wherever he goes for being the nicest, most liberal world leader around. But on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/22/trudeaus-india-visit-overshadowed-by-invitation-to-attempted-murderer\">recent trip to India</a>, he ran into some flak for dressing up in Indian clothes and being filmed doing Bhangra dancing at an official event. Some gave him the thumbs up for embracing the Indian lifestyle and demonstrating his hands-on inclusivity, but a rather greater number of people took offence, suggesting that Trudeau\u2019s idea of culture was lost in a time-warp of 1970s Bollywood films. It also made you wonder just where Trudeau would draw the line. On a visit to New Zealand, would he strip to the waist and do the Haka when meeting local Maori people? Or on a visit to Texas, would he wear a stetson and arm himself with a semi-automatic rifle? It would also be quite fun if, on his return visit to Canada, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, would disembark from the aircraft in Ottawa dressed as a Mountie and greet Trudeau with a solo rendition of The Lumberjack Song. Just to show how much he understands Canadian culture.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong><br></p> <p>Many people who live outside the M25 are probably right to suspect that the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/01/beast-from-east-storm-emma-uk-worst-weather-years\">beast from the east</a>\u201d is only getting so much attention in the media is because the snow and icy conditions have affected London. One friend, who lives in Herefordshire, said that he had six inches of snow before Christmas and nobody took a blind bit of notice. But this rather misses the point. One of the reasons people like me don\u2019t live in the country is precisely because we are complete wets who can\u2019t cope with extreme cold weather conditions. And by extreme, I mean a few degrees below freezing in the daytime. So when roads in London become mildly treacherous with a hint of ice, we panic. I\u2019ve tried to see the beauty in winter snowscapes, but my overwhelming feeling is always one of claustrophobia. Rather than think of the opportunities for enjoying the pristine whiteness out on Tooting Bec Common, my mind invariably turns to all the things I will be unable to do. I start to worry about not being able to get to work, being unable to fulfil engagements. Everything really. Even the garden. Though my anxieties over whether the banana plants that I wrapped up last November will survive are almost certainly displacement activity. The survival I\u2019m really worried about is my own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"704523acde18c44a41ad4e8eb5bb17f4a6e904d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/704523acde18c44a41ad4e8eb5bb17f4a6e904d0/0_214_6401_3843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snow in Brixton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cause for panic as the \u2018beast from the east\u2019 er ... savages south London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emerson Utracik/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Wednesday</strong><br></p> <p>There was concern among political reporters ahead of the annual Westminster correspondents\u2019 dinner as Theresa May was due to give the main speech. Given her track record there were fears she would die on her feet and the whole evening would end in embarrassment. But the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/01/maybot-jokes-boris-johnson-david-mad-max-davis-snap-election-westminster-correspondents-dinner\">proved a revelation</a>. There was not a trace of the Maybot on view. She was genuinely funny and witty \u2013 telling jokes against herself, her colleagues, the opposition and members of the lobby \u2013 and she delivered her speech with panache, comic timing and even an unexpected touch of smut. She even made it sound like a speech she might have written herself and not something she was reading for the first time. Yes, it was that good. Which left me wondering why she is so poor at giving the really important speeches that affect the future of the country. The only answer I could come up with is that this was a speech she actually believed in, whereas when she is talking about Brexit she knows she is clutching at straws.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong><br></p> <p>Barbra Streisand has revealed she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/28/barbra-streisand-cloned-her-dog-twice-variety\">two clones made of her adored dog</a>, Samantha, before it died last year. Now I well understand pet love. I\u2019d be devastated if anything happened to Herbert Hound. Only this week, he managed to cut his paw out walking on the common. Now has his leg in a bandage and is in danger of being given the cone of shame if he doesn\u2019t stop trying to tear it off, but it would never occur to me to want to replicate him. One of the things that makes him so special is that he is unique. Literally irreplaceable.

Not just for his attempts to make global political connections between art and history, but for his passion. Schama made the 25,000 year old ivory figurine of La Dame de Brassempouy almost come to life. That\u2019s a remarkable talent for a historian to possess. Interestingly, the only places where both Clark and Schama did struggle was in finding an over-arching definition of civilisation that wasn\u2019t vague or patronising. In the end, Shama appeared to settle for knowing civilisation by its absence.

          "bodyText": "Monday The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, normally gets love-bombed wherever he goes for being the nicest, most liberal world leader around. But on his recent trip to India, he ran into some flak for dressing up in Indian clothes and being filmed doing Bhangra dancing at an official event. Some gave him the thumbs up for embracing the Indian lifestyle and demonstrating his hands-on inclusivity, but a rather greater number of people took offence, suggesting that Trudeau\u2019s idea of culture was lost in a time-warp of 1970s Bollywood films. It also made you wonder just where Trudeau would draw the line. On a visit to New Zealand, would he strip to the waist and do the Haka when meeting local Maori people? Or on a visit to Texas, would he wear a stetson and arm himself with a semi-automatic rifle? It would also be quite fun if, on his return visit to Canada, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, would disembark from the aircraft in Ottawa dressed as a Mountie and greet Trudeau with a solo rendition of The Lumberjack Song. Just to show how much he understands Canadian culture. Tuesday Many people who live outside the M25 are probably right to suspect that the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d is only getting so much attention in the media is because the snow and icy conditions have affected London. One friend, who lives in Herefordshire, said that he had six inches of snow before Christmas and nobody took a blind bit of notice. But this rather misses the point. One of the reasons people like me don\u2019t live in the country is precisely because we are complete wets who can\u2019t cope with extreme cold weather conditions. And by extreme, I mean a few degrees below freezing in the daytime. So when roads in London become mildly treacherous with a hint of ice, we panic. I\u2019ve tried to see the beauty in winter snowscapes, but my overwhelming feeling is always one of claustrophobia. Rather than think of the opportunities for enjoying the pristine whiteness out on Tooting Bec Common, my mind invariably turns to all the things I will be unable to do. I start to worry about not being able to get to work, being unable to fulfil engagements. Everything really. Even the garden. Though my anxieties over whether the banana plants that I wrapped up last November will survive are almost certainly displacement activity. The survival I\u2019m really worried about is my own. Wednesday There was concern among political reporters ahead of the annual Westminster correspondents\u2019 dinner as Theresa May was due to give the main speech. Given her track record there were fears she would die on her feet and the whole evening would end in embarrassment. But the prime minister proved a revelation. There was not a trace of the Maybot on view. She was genuinely funny and witty \u2013 telling jokes against herself, her colleagues, the opposition and members of the lobby \u2013 and she delivered her speech with panache, comic timing and even an unexpected touch of smut. She even made it sound like a speech she might have written herself and not something she was reading for the first time. Yes, it was that good. Which left me wondering why she is so poor at giving the really important speeches that affect the future of the country. The only answer I could come up with is that this was a speech she actually believed in, whereas when she is talking about Brexit she knows she is clutching at straws. Thursday Barbra Streisand has revealed she had two clones made of her adored dog, Samantha, before it died last year. Now I well understand pet love. I\u2019d be devastated if anything happened to Herbert Hound. Only this week, he managed to cut his paw out walking on the common. Now has his leg in a bandage and is in danger of being given the cone of shame if he doesn\u2019t stop trying to tear it off, but it would never occur to me to want to replicate him. One of the things that makes him so special is that he is unique. Literally irreplaceable. So to go through the effort and expense of cloning \u2013 especially when as in Streisand\u2019s case, her dog was a pedigree so there would be no trouble finding a puppy that looked almost identical \u2013 would feel in some way wrong. Disrespectful. There again, it\u2019s her money and her sense of priorities. If I was to die, I can\u2019t imagine anyone in my family wanting to go through the process of cloning me. But that said, I do come lower down the pecking order than the dog. Friday I was 12 when Kenneth Clark\u2019s Civilisation was broadcast in 1969, and it was \u201cevent TV\u201d for the whole family.

The week-long tour of the subcontinent has been dogged by suggestions the Canadian prime minister is being snubbed by his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, over Canada\u2019s alleged indulgence of Sikh separatists aiming to create an independent state within India for the religious minority. The Canadian high commission in Delhi confirmed on Thursday it had sent, and has now rescinded, an official dinner invitation to Jaspal Atwal, a former member of a Sikh organisation regarded by India as a terrorist group. Atwal was convicted in 1986 of trying to kill Malkiat Singh Sidhu, then a minister in the Punjab government, who was on holiday in Canada at the time. Sidhu survived the attempt but was later assassinated in India. Photos were circulated on Thursday showing Atwal posing with Trudeau\u2019s wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, at an event in Mumbai earlier this week. Trudeau told journalists he took the matter very seriously. \u201cThe individual in question should have never received an invitation,\u201d he told reporters in Delhi. \u201cThe person and department responsible will take full responsibility for his actions.\u201d His office clarified Atwal was not part of Trudeau\u2019s official delegation. A Canadian MP, Randeep Surai, admitted organising the invitation. \u201cI should have exercised better judgment, and I take full responsibility for my actions,\u201d he said in a statement. On Wednesday, Trudeau met Amarinder Singh, the chief minister of Punjab state, which was the centre of decades of violent clashes, bombings and assassinations between Sikh separatists and the Indian state. About 80,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict, including the former Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard after ordering Indian troops into Amritsar\u2019s Golden Temple, one of Sikhism\u2019s most revered spiritual sites. The campaign was crushed in India by 1993 but its embers have been fanned by Sikh diasporas, especially in Canada, where Punjabi migrants and their descendants have become a rich voting block. About 1.4 million Canadians claim Indian descent. Trudeau has previously boasted that his cabinet has more Sikhs than Modi\u2019s and Canadian Sikh activists have succeeded in passing bills in provincial legislatures describing the anti-Sikh riots that followed Gandhi\u2019s assassination as a \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2013 terminology India balks at. In past months, dozens of Sikh temples in Canada have banned Indian officials from visiting in their official capacity. After meeting Trudeau, Singh\u2019s administration released a statement saying it had received \u201ccategorical assurance\u201d that Canada rejected the idea of creating a separate Sikh state. \u201cCiting the separatist movement in Quebec, Trudeau said he had dealt with such threats all his life and was fully aware of the dangers of violence, which he had always pushed back with all his might,\u201d the statement said.

          "bodyText": "When Rick Desautel shot the elk perched high on a steep hillside, he followed his typical routine: he retrieved the fallen animal, dressed it and packed out the meat to his hunting camp in the forests of western Canada. He then hiked down to an area with cell-phone reception and called the local conservation officers. \u201cIt took them a couple of days to find us,\u201d he laughs. He knew what was coming next: he was 40 miles north of the border and the officers would quickly find he was an American citizen without permits to hunt in the Canadian province of British Columbia. A conservation officer himself, he knew the standard procedure: he would accept the tickets, and as before, they would be dropped. But this time was different: after that hunting trip in 2010, the British Columbia government decided to bring the charges to court. The ensuing legal journey lasted more than eight years, as Desautel fought to prove his indigenous heritage, and thus his right to hunt in lands which were his ancestors\u2019 territory long before any border was drawn. The case appeared to reach an end in December, when the the provincial government lost its appeal at the British Columbia supreme court. Last month, however, the government filed papers to appeal yet again \u2013 a sign that it intends to continue its fight. That fight, however, could have unintended consequences: Desautel\u2019s case could set a precedent that would grant tens of thousands of Native Americans living in the United States a new set of rights \u2013 in Canada. The legal tussles comes as the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promises to abandon the strategy of forcing indigenous peoples to endure costly court battles to win recognition of rights. Desautel identifies as Sinixt, an indigenous people whose territory once stretched from southern British Columbia into Washington state. The Canadian government, however, declared the Sinixt extinct in 1955. But in March last year, the court affirmed his right to continue hunting in Canada \u2013 and restored the Sinixt\u2019s legal status, in an outcome he says made him feel \u201celated and joyful\u201d. But the British Columbia supreme court went one step further: by determining Desautel did not need to be a resident of Canada to be granted hunting rights, it transformed the case into one not just about identity \u2013 but also about the border. \u201cJudges tend to write decisions so that the judgment is specific to the case at hand. They try not to write decisions which have a overarching implications for the whole country,\u201d says Bruce Miller, an anthropologist at the University of British Columbia, who provided documentation to assist in proving the continued existence of the Sinixt. The border between Canada and the United States has long served as a barrier to recognition of indigenous people\u2019s traditional lands. \u201cIt cuts off my relationship to my ancestors,\u201d says Desautel. \u201cI can go just as far as the border. After that, [the government] says I have no more past.\u201d Several indigenous groups have contested the border, some more forcefully than others. The Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy issues its own passports and many of its members refuse to recognize the frontier at all. Experts believe the Desautel ruling could apply to tens of thousands of people living in the United States who were dispossessed of ancestral territory in Canada when the border was drawn, granting them new rights for hunting and fishing. By recognizing the hunting rights of indigenous communities based in the United States, the province must now reckon with other rights that follow, says Gordon Christie, a law professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on aboriginal legal issues. This could apply to consultation on resource projects like pipelines, a contentious issue where indigenous communities hold significant power at the bargaining table. Christie suspects this ruling could also apply to valuable water rights. The treaty governing the use of the Columbia River, one of North America\u2019s largest rivers, is up for renegotiation in the coming months, he says. \u201cThere could be some arguments that come up in those negotiations about what kinds of rights American tribes might have in relation to water that passes over the border,\u201d he says. By pursuing Desautel so aggressively, the government\u2019s plan to make an example of him appears to have backfired, says Signa Daum Shank, a legal expert on Indigenous claims. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t hunting a large number of animals.

          "body": "<p>At the New Democratic Party\u2019s convention this weekend in Ottawa, their new leader Jagmeet Singh declared \u201cthe time to be timid was over.\u201d For a party whose shambling meekness in the last election let Justin Trudeau claim the mantle of progressive champion, such a shift could not come sooner. </p> <p>That an opportunity exists to capitalize on enormous hunger for change is apparent. Trudeau harnessed it for his route to power, only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/jun/12/justin-trudeau-deploys-the-politics-of-hype-jeremy-corbyn-offers-politics-of-hope\">betray</a> it in office. The environmental Adonis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/stop-swooning-justin-trudeau-man-disaster-planet\">transformed</a> into an oil barons\u2019 salesman. An electoral reform promise was broken with a shrug. Instead of a peace offensive, we\u2019ve gotten a military <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/07/19/flexing-military-might-shows-trudeau-not-a-us-lapdog-mcquaig.html\">spending</a> spree; instead of novel social programs, novelty socks. </p> <p>The agenda the NDP began unveiling this weekend, however, needs to become a whole lot bolder. Expanding healthcare to cover drugs and dental-care, stopping pension theft and new privatizations, closing tax loopholes, and building affordable housing: this is an end to the disastrous right-wing slide of past NDP leaders, but it\u2019s not nearly ambitious enough. For years they\u2019ve seemed to believe success depended on becoming indistinguishable from centrist, corporate-friendly Liberals: the point now is to become demonstrably different.<br></p> <p>One problem is that the Liberals can claim they are already pursuing many of these policies \u2013 or, as in the case of pharma-care, that it may soon be in their platform. But the main problem is this: it doesn\u2019t truly break with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\">neoliberal economic consensus</a> in Canada that has devastated peoples\u2019 lives and turned so many off politics. </p> <p>Massive tax cuts for the rich, deregulation, privatization, corporate trade deals, and more money for prisons and police: this elite agenda has dominated for nearly four decades. It is why two billionaires <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oxfam-davos-report-canadians-wealth-1.3937073\">own</a> as much as wealth as the bottom third; why wages for a majority have not <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3531614/average-hourly-wage-canada-stagnant/\">budged</a>; why corporations have been unshackled to treat the atmosphere like a sewage dump. And yet the population seems more <a href=\"http://www.ekospolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/understanding_the_middle_class_final_report.pdf\">clued</a> in than any of the political parties: \u201cTrickle-down economics has been laid bare as a cruel hoax, in the view of many Canadians.\u201d That\u2019s not a line from an issue of the Socialist Worker but from mainstream pollsters.</p> <p>None of neoliberalism\u2019s consequences is more insidious than the structural timidity it has entrenched. As the state\u2019s capacity for positive intervention has been shrunk, political parties have withdrawn from proposing solutions that match the scale our crises. Policy has been eclipsed by a fixation on personality.<br></p> <p>It is folly to think Singh can succeed by playing into this trend, rather than bucking it. Dapper suits, boasts about boxing or wrestling skills, hopey slogans, making a show of public access to candid private moments: all of these are already found in Justin Trudeau\u2019s playbook. And while the discrimination Singh has faced is vital to share to show the need to combat racism in Canada, his individual story can\u2019t become a stand-in for a collective vision: he has to be a pitchman, not the product.<br> </p> <p>What is firing people up around the world are not flashy personalities but far-reaching policies. It\u2019s a good start that Singh has rejected balanced budgets \u2013 a destructive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/14/the-fatal-flaw-of-neoliberalism-its-bad-economics\">neoliberal mantra</a> that has transfixed the NDP for a generation, and allowed them to be out-flanked by Trudeau. So too is the refreshing fact that Singh has begun <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/singh-says-taxes-are-an-investment-in-the-future/article38018829/\">arguing</a> the case for taxation. A bold and transformative agenda funded by taxes and historic government spending, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated in the UK, is not a risk in elections. It is a sure-fire recipe for success. </p> <p> A dramatic challenge to neoliberalism would be just as popular in Canada. The NDP could propose not merely to close tax loopholes, but to hike the rates paid by the corporations and ultra-rich \u2013 which haven\u2019t been lower since WW2. To expand healthcare, but also create new public services: free tuition, universal childcare, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/mar/09/canadas-post-office-is-getting-a-revolutionary-green-make-over\">public bank</a> to supplant the predatory loansharks. To defend our deteriorating public infrastructure, and to move to publicly own other sectors: energy, railways, or telecoms providers. To go beyond symbolic support for reconciliation to amplify concrete Indigenous demands for land restitution.</p> <p> And it is not the moment to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/singh-pipeline-bc-alberta-trans-mountain-1.4540543\">address</a> the crisis of climate change with prevarication and platitude. That is already the method of the governing Liberals. People are ready to vote for a clean and cooperative economy that unleashes good-paying jobs in renewable energy instead of stop-gaping an oil industry that is on the way out.</p> <p>The surest way to tell that a NDP agenda could massively lift ordinary people\u2019s prospects and electrify the public? A backlash from the media and political class. As organizers from the Corbyn and Bernie Sanders campaigns <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/new-democrats-hear-leap-manifesto-push-on-eve-of-convention\">shared</a> on the outskirts of the convention, backlashes only underlined their anti-establishment bonafides. The elite aren\u2019t too worried, going by their current response: a murmur of self-serving approval for Singh\u2019s plans. The NDP has yet to realize that the howls of out-of-touch pundits would not be a mark of its failure but a guarantee of its promise.</p> <p> It\u2019s also how the party could inspire people to go door-knocking for it across the country.

          "bodyText": "At the New Democratic Party\u2019s convention this weekend in Ottawa, their new leader Jagmeet Singh declared \u201cthe time to be timid was over.\u201d For a party whose shambling meekness in the last election let Justin Trudeau claim the mantle of progressive champion, such a shift could not come sooner. That an opportunity exists to capitalize on enormous hunger for change is apparent. Trudeau harnessed it for his route to power, only to betray it in office. The environmental Adonis transformed into an oil barons\u2019 salesman. An electoral reform promise was broken with a shrug. Instead of a peace offensive, we\u2019ve gotten a military spending spree; instead of novel social programs, novelty socks. The agenda the NDP began unveiling this weekend, however, needs to become a whole lot bolder. Expanding healthcare to cover drugs and dental-care, stopping pension theft and new privatizations, closing tax loopholes, and building affordable housing: this is an end to the disastrous right-wing slide of past NDP leaders, but it\u2019s not nearly ambitious enough. For years they\u2019ve seemed to believe success depended on becoming indistinguishable from centrist, corporate-friendly Liberals: the point now is to become demonstrably different. One problem is that the Liberals can claim they are already pursuing many of these policies \u2013 or, as in the case of pharma-care, that it may soon be in their platform. But the main problem is this: it doesn\u2019t truly break with the neoliberal economic consensus in Canada that has devastated peoples\u2019 lives and turned so many off politics. Massive tax cuts for the rich, deregulation, privatization, corporate trade deals, and more money for prisons and police: this elite agenda has dominated for nearly four decades. It is why two billionaires own as much as wealth as the bottom third; why wages for a majority have not budged; why corporations have been unshackled to treat the atmosphere like a sewage dump. And yet the population seems more clued in than any of the political parties: \u201cTrickle-down economics has been laid bare as a cruel hoax, in the view of many Canadians.\u201d That\u2019s not a line from an issue of the Socialist Worker but from mainstream pollsters. None of neoliberalism\u2019s consequences is more insidious than the structural timidity it has entrenched. As the state\u2019s capacity for positive intervention has been shrunk, political parties have withdrawn from proposing solutions that match the scale our crises. Policy has been eclipsed by a fixation on personality. It is folly to think Singh can succeed by playing into this trend, rather than bucking it. Dapper suits, boasts about boxing or wrestling skills, hopey slogans, making a show of public access to candid private moments: all of these are already found in Justin Trudeau\u2019s playbook. And while the discrimination Singh has faced is vital to share to show the need to combat racism in Canada, his individual story can\u2019t become a stand-in for a collective vision: he has to be a pitchman, not the product. What is firing people up around the world are not flashy personalities but far-reaching policies. It\u2019s a good start that Singh has rejected balanced budgets \u2013 a destructive neoliberal mantra that has transfixed the NDP for a generation, and allowed them to be out-flanked by Trudeau. So too is the refreshing fact that Singh has begun arguing the case for taxation. A bold and transformative agenda funded by taxes and historic government spending, as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated in the UK, is not a risk in elections. It is a sure-fire recipe for success. A dramatic challenge to neoliberalism would be just as popular in Canada. The NDP could propose not merely to close tax loopholes, but to hike the rates paid by the corporations and ultra-rich \u2013 which haven\u2019t been lower since WW2. To expand healthcare, but also create new public services: free tuition, universal childcare, and a public bank to supplant the predatory loansharks. To defend our deteriorating public infrastructure, and to move to publicly own other sectors: energy, railways, or telecoms providers. To go beyond symbolic support for reconciliation to amplify concrete Indigenous demands for land restitution. And it is not the moment to address the crisis of climate change with prevarication and platitude. That is already the method of the governing Liberals. People are ready to vote for a clean and cooperative economy that unleashes good-paying jobs in renewable energy instead of stop-gaping an oil industry that is on the way out. The surest way to tell that a NDP agenda could massively lift ordinary people\u2019s prospects and electrify the public? A backlash from the media and political class. As organizers from the Corbyn and Bernie Sanders campaigns shared on the outskirts of the convention, backlashes only underlined their anti-establishment bonafides. The elite aren\u2019t too worried, going by their current response: a murmur of self-serving approval for Singh\u2019s plans. The NDP has yet to realize that the howls of out-of-touch pundits would not be a mark of its failure but a guarantee of its promise. It\u2019s also how the party could inspire people to go door-knocking for it across the country. What was on display at the Ottawa convention - while larger, younger and more diverse than ever - was a party still bent on controlling and managing the energy of its grassroots, rather than empowering and channeling it. Widely-supported resolutions on free tuition and more democratic decision-making were resisted and could end up ignored; another on Palestinian rights was stifled completely. There was a similar dynamic when members voted in 2016 to study and engage with the Leap Manifesto: it generated a flood of enthusiasm and revived interest in the party, before it was buried by the establishment. The vibrancy of a new generation of activists should not be squandered. If the NDP wants to revive their chances, becoming a less timid version of Justin Trudeau won\u2019t cut it. They can\u2019t hem and haw within Canada\u2019s neoliberal consensus \u2013 they have to overthrow it. Twitter: @Martin_Lukacs",

          "bodyText": "After an all-white jury cleared a white farmer of murdering a young First Nations man, competing crowdfunding pages have underlined the persistent racial divide in Canada\u2019s prairies. Gerald Stanley, 56, was acquitted on Friday of murdering Colten Boushie, 22, from Saskatchewan\u2019s Red Pheasant First Nation, in a verdict which provoked fresh criticism of the way Canada\u2019s justice system handles cases involving indigenous people. Since then, supporters from each side have taken to social media in order to raise money for the Stanley and Boushie families \u2013 with both pages surpassing $120,000 in donations. Erica Violet Lee, who launched the campaign to support the Boushie family, said that the crowdfunding push was also intended to keep the memory of Colten Boushie alive. \u201cAlmost every indigenous person knows each other [in the region] because we have a tight and loving community, \u201d says Lee. \u201cI\u2019ve seen stuff like this over and over again. But now, we know to document things. We know to talk about it \u2013otherwise people are too willing to forget.\u201d Meanwhile, more than 2,000 people have donated money to help Stanley cover his legal fees. Several previous pages supporting Stanley have been taken down for breaching GoFundMe user policies, but the crowdfunding service has declined to remove the latest version. The company prohibits the use of its services for the legal defence of alleged crimes associated with \u201chate, violence, harassment, bullying or discrimination\u201d. The Stanley page has angered many in the indigenous community. \u201cI was shocked by the amount that they managed to raise in one day \u2013 and the amount of malice involved in the donations themselves,\u201d says Chelsea Vowel, a prominent M\u00e9tis writer. Sam Olson, the administrator behind the Stanley page, did not respond to a request for comment. But some contributors echoed Stanley, who argued in court that he feared his farming equipment would be stolen. According to Boushie\u2019s family, Clayton and his four companions pulled into Stanley\u2019s farm after a flat tyre. \u201cThere was no respect for him or his property,\u201d Mark Pashovitz, a farmer who donated $1,000, told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt could have been me.\u201d Demographic shifts in recent years have also increased tension in Canada\u2019s western provinces: white farmers are declining in number as their children opt out of the family business and move to larger cities. Meanwhile, the indigenous population is growing quickly and in some areas, outnumbering the farmers. Vowel said that some farmers live their whole life beside an indigenous reservation and never set foot inside. \u201cHere we are living right beside people and there\u2019s such a divide between us. It\u2019s like the Marianas trench. It\u2019s just so intensely deep,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, Boushie\u2019s family met the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and other ministers in Ottawa. Afterwards, Jade Tootoosis, a cousin of Boushie, said: \u201cThe most significant thing is that there was a general consensus that there are systemic issues regarding indigenous people and the judicial system and that each person has promised to work with us to make concrete changes within the system. And that\u2019s exactly what we came here for.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2018 to correct Gerald Stanley\u2019s age from 66 to 56 and to remove a reference that said Chelsea Vowel was a lawyer.",

Gerald Stanley, 56, was found not guilty of second-degree murder over the death of Colten Boushie, 22, from Red Pheasant First Nation in the province of Saskatchewan. Boushie\u2019s family and aboriginal activists say the racial makeup of the jury underscored a weakness in the country\u2019s court system, which allows defence teams to manipulate jury lineups in their favour.

          "bodyText": "The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has come under fire for \u201cmansplaining\u201d and being too politically correct after he interrupted a woman and lightheartedly corrected her for saying \u201cmankind\u201d not \u201cpeoplekind\u201d at a town hall event in Canada on Friday. His correction came at the conclusion of a longwinded question from anaudience member that, over the course of three minutes, included a discussion of her church and the special power of \u201cmaternal love\u201d. The questioner ended by asking Trudeau to look at laws surrounding the charitable status of religious organisations, saying , \u201cmaternal love is the love that\u2019s going to change the future of mankind\u201d. To which Trudeau said: \u201cWe like to say \u2018peoplekind\u2019, not necessarily \u2018mankind\u2019, because it\u2019s more inclusive.\u201d His comments have drawn ridicule from conservative media who have seized on them to accuse him of \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d, being too politically correct and for \u201cmansplaining\u201d, a term coined by a feminist author and popularised by feminist discourse. The Australian conservative commentator Rita Panahi said Trudeau\u2019s use of \u201cpeoplekind\u201d was an attempt to \u201cappease those desperate to find offence where none exists\u201d. Fox News dedicated a segment to the controversy, enlisting the help of Jordan Peterson, a Canadian professor who has found fame after arguing against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, especially the use of preferred pronouns. However, some have suggested that the rightwing furore surrounding his comments has been manufactured in bad faith. Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star, said that the \u201cpile-on\u201d was misleading as Trudeau was \u201clightly ribbing a woman who was rambling about the power of women\u201d and accused it of omitting important context. The woman did indeed thank the prime minister for his correction and Trudeau allowed her a considerable time to speak. The prime minister has made comments in the past that have come under fire for their seeming facetiousness.",

Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner.</p> <p>I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. </p> <p>We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u2019t work.</p> <p>The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect.</p> <p>[On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u2019t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally].</p> <p>The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau.</p> <p>If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue.</p> <p>We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do].</p> <p>Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people]</p> <p>I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion.</p> <p>At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies.</p> <p>Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. </p> <p>In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important.</p> <p>But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u2019t be credible.</p> <p>China\u2019s new Silk Road has to be a green road.</p> <p>I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding.</p> <p>The private sector must also live up to its commitments.</p> <p>Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing. In EU and eurozone we need to have a way of having a green financial sector.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68bc16e4b00f225a1c72f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T17:11:11.997Z\">5.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Macron, who has been mostly been speaking in English, reverts to French.</p> <p>Europe should find a new ambition. Economic growth is not an end in itself. We\u2019ve made a mistake saying things will get better because we have growth.</p> <p>The search for growth has sometimes made us forget what it takes to achieve it.</p> <p>Some people thought that if we had growth, all problems will be solved. Not the case, because this growth is less equitable.</p> <p>You cannot have a one stop solution. You have to co-ordinate positions.</p> <p>Everything is being fragmented. We have societies made up of nomads. There are more and more people who think getting out of globalisation is the right option.</p> <p>We have a major challenge, not just for governments. A lot of governments think you have to be more nationalist. States have often gone in wrong direction because we undermined internationalism.</p> <p>For many years we have been going in the wrong direction.</p> <p>In terms of trade we are moving back to strategies of non-co-operation, undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve.</p> <p>For climate change we have not be able to achieve what we have said we would achieve.</p> <p>And we haven\u2019t established an organisation at a world level which looks at artificial intelligence and automation. We allow private companies to control this.</p> <p>We have never had a multilateral approach to this. We are encouraging technological change..and we are in danger of living in a Darwinian world.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68bad7e4b0ff7aa1a41e6a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T17:02:08.239Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My message is France is back.</p> <p>We will never have French success without European success.</p> <p>Angela Merkel expressed her vision and we worked very closely in that direction.</p> <p>The core strategy is: we have to fix some short term measures.</p> <p> But we have to also redesign a ten year strategy for Europe. Europe has a role to play vis a vis China and the US.<br></p> <p>If we want to avoid fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe.</p> <p>We have to have a 10 year strategy to make Europe a green, scientific and political power. We need more ambition to have a more united Europe.</p> <p>I\u2019m not naive, we will not build something that ambition at 27. But we have to change our methodology, not wait for all the people round the table to go forward, Those who do not want to move forward should not block the most ambitious people in the room.</p> <p>This will make our eurozone much stronger, fairer.</p> <p>At the end of this year, we hope for a common strategy for ten years.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68b8f3e4b0473d0bc0fb34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T16:56:49.889Z\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>First, its about human capital.</p> <p>Our world has changed. We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university.</p> <p>We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u20ac15bn in education and retraining over five years.</p> <p>We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u20ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies.</p> <p>The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain.</p> <p>We have reinforced France\u2019s attractiveness.</p> <p>The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt.</p> <p>The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive.</p> <p>Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause).</p> <p>Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations.</p> <p>We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment.</p> <p>It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure.</p> <p>France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u2019s history.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68b72de4b0473d0bc0fb0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T16:48:48.361Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We have taken action but let us not be naive.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u2019s best session for more than a month.</p> <p>Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u2019s growth is coming from the dollar\u2019s bruised and battered start to 2018.</p> <p>Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog.</p> <p>Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen.</p> <p>Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u2019s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro.</p> <p>With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u2019s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68a09de4b01fba01150fac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T15:07:48.477Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More US data, and a weak housing market report for December.</p> <p>Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.</p> <p>But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country.

Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u2019s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u20ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation.</p> <p>Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u2013 the first hike in a decade.</p> <p>This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure.</p> <p>According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u2019s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance.</p> <p>We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u2019s data could make a rise this year more likely:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19.</p> <p>However, today\u2019s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile here\u2019s our full story on the day\u2019s UK data:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/24/uk-employment-level-hits-joint-highest-since-1971\">UK employment level hits joint highest since 1971</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:20:56.796Z\">at 12.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a687646e4b04cea3dc7ab1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T12:08:05.318Z\">12.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month.</p> <p>IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lagarde/status/956134151454896128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very please to meet in Davos with Portugal\u2019s Prime Minister Antonio Costa and congratulated Finance Minister Mario Centeno on his election as President of Eurogroup.

However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit.</p> <p>This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u2013 that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU. Accommodation and food services, where one in six workers are EU migrants is one such sector.

Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present.</p> <p>After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u2019s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u2019s agreement to financial terms.</p> <p>But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high.</p> <p>The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u2019s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained.</p> <p>For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u2013 put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u2013 have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u2019s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets.</p> <p>Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:49:29.092Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a685ea7e4b04cea3dc7a9f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:30:30.358Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded.

But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u2019ll come to an end in the next few months.

          "bodyText": "Some late news: Seven Latin American countries are to benefit from a new anti-malaria initiative unveiled in Davos by the philanthropist Bill Gates and the Inter-American development bank. The Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative is expected to deliver more than $180mn to fight the disease in Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Money from the Gates Foundation, the IDB and the Carlos Slim totalling more than $80bn is expected to leverage in a further $100mn from the countries affected. Gates said: \u201cThis collaboration will build on each of the partners\u2019 unique capabilities and expertise to cover financial and technical gaps in the region, demonstrating that we can eliminate malaria today using current tools. It will also help strengthen health systems in the region, positioning countries for success against other high-priority vector-borne diseases such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya.\u201d More Macron reaction: I think the social contract has to involve all the stakeholders. We have to fight against strategy of free riding. A new global and shared framework should be based on co-operation and multilateralism..We have a tremendous responsibility.. The answer is partly here in this room. In a way our new frontier is our commitment. If we commit ourselves to make our current globalisation more fair..so we can converge and build a new globalisation. We have a question. Do we decide to do it or no? And this is now? (Applause as he ends) We are committed to fighting against terrorism. We need to continue to work with our partners at military and diplomatic levels... Sometimes we thought getting rid of a tyrant we didn\u2019t like would get what we wanted... But we have to win the war against terrorism and create conditions for a durable peace...We need to provide a development and education policy. I think we have to reconnect with a framework which provides for the common good. Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner. I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u2019t work. The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect. [On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u2019t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally]. The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau. If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue. We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do]. Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people] I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion. At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies. Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important. But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u2019t be credible. China\u2019s new Silk Road has to be a green road. I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding. The private sector must also live up to its commitments. Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing. In EU and eurozone we need to have a way of having a green financial sector. Macron, who has been mostly been speaking in English, reverts to French. Europe should find a new ambition. Economic growth is not an end in itself. We\u2019ve made a mistake saying things will get better because we have growth. The search for growth has sometimes made us forget what it takes to achieve it. Some people thought that if we had growth, all problems will be solved. Not the case, because this growth is less equitable. You cannot have a one stop solution. You have to co-ordinate positions. Everything is being fragmented. We have societies made up of nomads. There are more and more people who think getting out of globalisation is the right option. We have a major challenge, not just for governments. A lot of governments think you have to be more nationalist. States have often gone in wrong direction because we undermined internationalism. For many years we have been going in the wrong direction. In terms of trade we are moving back to strategies of non-co-operation, undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve. For climate change we have not be able to achieve what we have said we would achieve. And we haven\u2019t established an organisation at a world level which looks at artificial intelligence and automation. We allow private companies to control this. We have never had a multilateral approach to this. We are encouraging technological change..and we are in danger of living in a Darwinian world. My message is France is back. We will never have French success without European success. Angela Merkel expressed her vision and we worked very closely in that direction. The core strategy is: we have to fix some short term measures. But we have to also redesign a ten year strategy for Europe. Europe has a role to play vis a vis China and the US. If we want to avoid fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe. We have to have a 10 year strategy to make Europe a green, scientific and political power. We need more ambition to have a more united Europe. I\u2019m not naive, we will not build something that ambition at 27. But we have to change our methodology, not wait for all the people round the table to go forward, Those who do not want to move forward should not block the most ambitious people in the room. This will make our eurozone much stronger, fairer. At the end of this year, we hope for a common strategy for ten years. First, its about human capital. Our world has changed. We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university. We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u20ac15bn in education and retraining over five years. We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u20ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies. The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain. We have reinforced France\u2019s attractiveness. The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt. The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive. Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause). Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations. We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment. It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure. France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u2019s history. We have taken action but let us not be naive. Globalisation is going through a challenge. I came here to make a call for action, to all and every one of us. France has been affected by change and globalisation. A few months ago I had to fight with a nationalist party, since there was a lack of understanding about globalisation in my country. Why, we didn\u2019t deliver, results were poor. Some people proposed getting out of globalisation as a solution. I have the responsibility to build a France that is prosperous and open, but also standing for those left behind. I have to make France more competitive to finance a fair system. Macron says we are talking about globalisation in a place cut off from the rest of the world by snow. It is hard here to believe in global warming, and you didnt invite anyone sceptical of global warming this year. Applause. A video clip has emerged of David Cameron, former UK PM, describing Brexit as \u201ca mistake, not a disaster\u201d: French president Emmanuel Macron is next up at Davos. Today is being billed as a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d by Greek government officials as prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets his Macedonian counterpart in Davos. A solution to the seemingly unsolvable dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia could be solved in Davos. That, at least, is what both sides are hoping as Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev meet this afternoon. The bilateral meeting takes the quest for a settlement a notch up the diplomatic scale and is being seen as possibly groundbreaking. The two Balkan neighbours have been at odds over the former republic\u2019s name for the past 25 years with Greece\u2019 asserting that exclusive use of the nomenclature \u201cMacedonia\u201d conceals territorial ambitions against its own eponymous region of Macedonia. Around 100,000 demonstrators protested over the issue in the northern Greek capital of Thessaloniki on Sunday. \u201cIt will be a moment of truth,\u201d said a senior Greek official adding that it would allow Athens to see how far Skopje was willing to compromise on the issue. More on the pound\u2019s current buoyancy, and more to the point, the dollar\u2019s decline. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u2019s best session for more than a month. Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u2019s growth is coming from the dollar\u2019s bruised and battered start to 2018. Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog. Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen. Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u2019s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro. With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u2019s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling. More US data, and a weak housing market report for December. Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market. But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country. These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace. NF We\u2019ve had the initial January PMI numbers for January for the US, and unlike Europe it is manufacturing which is outperforming, rather than the service sector. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI has climbed from 55.1 in December to 55.5, while the services PMI slipped from 53.7 to 53.3. The composite index edged down from 54.1 to 53.8. Despite the dips, all the indices were above 50, showing expansion rather than contraction. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson, said: January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year. Although the overall pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys waned to an eight-month low, the forward-looking indicators suggest the slowdown will prove transitory. In particular, business optimism about the year ahead improved markedly and inflows of new orders hit a five-month high. Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. NF US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%. NF A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast: NF Returning to the dangers of populism, Angela Merkel warns of the \u2018poisonous mix\u2019 created if people feel they are getting an unfair deal. She warns against descending into stereotypes, saying: When you say Americans are protectionist by nature, Germans are tight-fisted by nature, you are generalising. The next thing is Muslims are like this, Christians are like that. If you not respect each person\u2019s individuality, and already have your pre-conceived notion before you even talk to them, that is the very basis of populism. We want to have a good partnership with Britain in the future, Merkel continues. Access to the single market is contingent on the freedoms, including freedom of movement. It\u2019s in their hands how close they want the partnership to be. We are prepared to be open-minded about this partnership. Angela Merkel now turns to the digital revolution, warning of the social damage that it could cause. It\u2019s not enough to just convince 20% or 30% of the population of the benefits of the digital age. Policymakers need to help people who will otherwise be left behind, she says. The chancellor repeats her earlier point that we must avoid making the mistakes of the 20th century again. The new digital economy creates good opportunities, Merkel says, but it also creates \u201cenormous confusion, and people feel left behind\u201d We must create a true social market economy as we say in Germany in this digital age. Merkel ends with a request - keep your fingers crossed for us getting into government as soon as possible. Are you listening, Donald? Turning to Brexit, Angela Merkel says Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is regrettable. But on the upside, it has given Europe \u201cthe courage to move forwards\u201d. She also name checks France\u2019s new(ish) leader, Emmanuel Macron, saying his victory last spring has given a new impetus to Europe\u2019s reform drive. Merkel is making some important points about Europe\u2019s role in the world: Angela Merkel warns that populism is on the rise, with a \u201cpolarising state of affairs in many countries\u201d. The German chancellor cites the \u201cdisruptive changes of technology\u201d, which is shaking up society and worrying people. There is also polarisation in Germany for the first time in decades, Merkel continues - following the eurozone crisis, and challenge of migration. Merkel reminds us that she is still holding talks to form a new government (with the social democratic party). But she\u2019s certain that Germany wants to make a contribution to solving the problems of the world. Shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will not help she says, adding: Protectionism is not the proper answer. Next up: German chancellor Angela Merkel take the stage. She reminds delegates that 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. The political actors a century ago \u2018sleepwalked\u2019 into a crisis, Merkel says. We must ask ourselves...have we learned the lessons of history, Merkel continued. And she suggests we have not, declaring: This generation born after the second world war will have to prove they have learned the lessons of history. That means remaining committed to multilateralism, working together to solve problems, Merkel continues. Taking questions, Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni says that the issue of migration had a big influence on the Brexit vote. Italy is sticking to its principles, though, he says - saving the lives of those who try to get to Europe, and refusing to close its ports to those who cross the sea. Gentiloni says: This is one of the more costly political decisions you can take in these times. but this is the Italian decision, full stop. And finally, Donald Trump speaks to Davos in two days time - what is your message to him. \u201cWelcome to Davos\u201d, Gentiloni wisecracks. But he then makes a serious point - that there is a limit to how far any one country can push things within the current framework. Yes you can defend and protect your citizens, your workers, your companies, but we live in a framework of trade agreements, free trade, international rules, multilateral decisions, and we have to keep this system running. Turning to new technology, Gentiloni says that digital innovation is threatening the quantity and quality of available jobs. We must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers. And on Europe, the Italian PM says that the \u201cperfect storm\u201d caused by the Brexit vote, the economic crisis and unchecked migration is over. The EU now has an opportunity to relaunch itself. Gentiloni says firmly: These years are now behind our back. Those who have bet on a final crisis of the European Union have clearly lost. Italy is doing its bit to help with the migration crisis, Paulo Gentiloni says, saying that Italian investment is helping the African economy. The Italian PM then reminds his audience that Italy has an election in 40 days - he hopes that populist forces will not prevail [unfortunately for Gentiloni, his Democratic party is lagging in the polls]. Populism, Gentiloni says, frequently gives the wrong answers to the right questions. Politicians must not ignore the \u2018deep causes\u2019 of discontent among their citizens, he says There are still unacceptably large parts of our populations who feel unsatisfied with their conditions and worried about the future. The damage caused by the great recession has still not been mended, Gentiloni continues. Economic growth is not reducing inequalities, but in many countries including Italy they are still widening, even if economic growth is there. They are reaching even more intolerable levels. Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni is on his feet - telling Davos that Italy\u2019s economy is improving. Gentiloni says: In the last two years, our economy is back to growth, and now it\u2019s picking up speed. One year ago, the IMF forecast that we would only grow by 0.7% in 2017. Actual growth in 2017, according to the IMF, was 1.6%. He adds: Exports rose by 9.7% between November 2016 and 2017. Employment is up by one million units, to a 40-year high. Gentiloni says his government is doing its best to improve the business conditions, reform the labour market, raise skills and cut bureaucracy. This reforming effort must continue, and will continue, while our public debt must decrease at a steady and sustainable pace. There\u2019s a buzz in the main Davos congress hall, as delegates prepare to hear from Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni, and then German chancellor Angela Merkel. Jack Ma has also warned Davos that technology could trigger a third world war, unless leaders work together to mitigate its disruptive effects. He says: \u201cThe first technology revolution caused the First World War and the second technology revolution caused the Second World War - and now we have the third. \u201cIf there is a Third World War I think that should be a war against disease, pollution and poverty, not a war against ourselves. \u201cIf we don\u2019t align together , human beings are going to fight each other, because each technology revolution makes the world unbalanced.\u201d Hopes of a showdown between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker at Davos tomorrow have been dashed. The EC president has cancelled his visit after contracting stomach flu, so he won\u2019t be giving his scheduled speech tomorrow. Here\u2019s another quote from Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, urging policymakers not to trigger a trade war: \u201cGlobalization is a growing pain. It is so easy to launch a trade war but it is so difficult to stop a trade war and I\u2019m scared and concerned.\u201d Sterling is climbing higher again, now up more than 1% at $1.4152. Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u2019s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u20ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says: While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u2013 the first hike in a decade. This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure. According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u2019s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance. We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon. Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u2019s data could make a rise this year more likely: We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19. However, today\u2019s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year. Meanwhile here\u2019s our full story on the day\u2019s UK data: NF One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too. She even squeezed in a chat with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. E-commerce magnate Jack Ma has made a passionate plea to world leaders t Davos not to launch a trade war. Speaking on a panel, the head of China\u2019s Alibaba says trade should be a solution to the world\u2019s problems. If you used it as a weapon, young people and businesses will suffer most. Ma says: \u2018They will be killed, just like when you bomb somewhere\u2019. An important view, given the tensions between China and the US - and Wilbur Ross\u2019s comment about America \u2018coming to the ramparts\u2019. Back in Davos, the World Economic Forum have launched a new \u201cGlobal Centre for Cybersecurity\u201d Based in Geneva, it\u2019s meant to help build a safe and secure global cyberspace, and protect businesses and governments from online attacks. Interpol and BT are also involved. J\u00fcrgen Stock, Secretary General of Interpol, says this partnership will address the \u201cglobal threat\u201d of cybercrime. The pound has peaked at $1.4118 against the dollar, for the moment at least. But it is still up 0.7% so far today at $1.4097. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A green-gilled greenback and a half decent UK jobs report made for a very strong Wednesday for the pound. Kicking the currency while it was down, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed at a press conference in Davos that a weaker dollar is good for the country\u2019s economy \u2018as it relates to trade and opportunities\u2019. This turned an already bad morning worse for the greenback, with the currency falling 0.4% against the euro, where it\u2019s sunk to a fresh 3 and a bit year nadir, and 0.7% against both the yen and the pound. Sterling\u2019s gains against the dollar caused cable to flit about the $1.41 mark for the first time since the Brexit referendum result back in June 2016. The pound didn\u2019t stop there, however; it also rose 0.4% against the euro, lifting back to its best price in just shy of 7 weeks. The FTSE wasn\u2019t best pleased with all this, dipping 0.2% as it continued to shed its early 2018 record-breaking momentum. The pound was aided by a UK jobs report that by and large didn\u2019t ruffle any feathers. Wage growth came in unchanged at 2.5%, and rose to from 2.3% to 2.4% excluding bonuses \u2013 in terms of its relation to inflation, though real wages are still being squeezed there are signs that this should ease in the coming months \u2013 while unemployment fell by 3000 to 1.44 million (the unemployment rate didn\u2019t actually change, remaining steady at 4.3%). NF Back with the UK data. From Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon: Earlier, as well as the preliminary PMIs for France and Germany, there were also estimates for the eurozone as a whole. This showed the same pattern, with manufacturing slipping back in January and services rising. The eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped from 60.6 to 59.8 while services climbed from 56.6 to 57.6. The composite index rose from 58.1 to 58.6. Unicredit Bank economist Edoardo Campanella said: The eurozone starts 2018 with a bang, continuing to churn out solid economic figures. January\u2019s Composite PMI hit a near 12-year high, rising to 58.6 from 58.1 and pointing to annualized GDP growth of almost 4%. Economic activity further accelerated in the services sector to the fastest pace since August 2007, while it slowed down in the manufacturing industry \u2013 after having recorded an all-time high last December. NF The UK jobs data today shows the difficulties employers are having filling vacancies, especially those companies which use a large number of EU migrant workers, says theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research. Associate research director Dr Heather Rolfe said: UK labour market statistics released today show employment in the 3 months up to November 2017 is at a record high, driven by an increase in full time employment. However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit. This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u2013 that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU. Accommodation and food services, where one in six workers are EU migrants is one such sector. The challenges of attracting and retaining workers are likely to increase with prolonged uncertainty about the terms of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. NF Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling breached $1.41 to record another post-Brexit high as a renewed bout of dollar softness and some better-than-expected employment numbers fuelled bids. Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present. After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u2019s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u2019s agreement to financial terms. But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high. The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u2019s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained. For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u2013 put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u2013 have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u2019s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets. Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in. NF Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u2019ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: While it is encouraging that regular earnings growth picked up slightly, subdued economic conditions are likely to weigh on wage growth over the next year. As a consequence, pay growth is likely to remain stubbornly below price growth over the near term, dampening consumer spending, a key driver of UK GDP growth. NF The president of Brazil, Michael Temer, is speaking now -- encouraging business leaders to provide fresh investment. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The relentless rise in sterling, which has seen it jump over 3% in the last 10 days is looking durable. The good news for the economy is that more people are working with rising wages despite any uncertainty associated with leaving the European Union. Lord Jim O\u2019Neil looks vindicated so far in his belief that strong domestic and global growth will overcome Brexit headwinds. Matthew Brittain, investment analyst at wealth manager Sanlam UK, said: The real worry [for the UK economy] is centred around the consumer where wages have been increasing at a lower rate than inflation (ie falling in \u201creal\u201d terms). So another bright spot in this release is that weekly earnings ticked up from 2.3 to 2.4% versus a year ago, which is still lower than inflation (3%) but at least the gap is steadily being closed Since the data makes it slightly more likely that the Bank of England will increase interest rates later on in the year the immediate reaction is a rise in sterling to \u00a31.41 with bonds and equities both under a little pressure. NF Sterling has climbed above $1.41 against the dollar after the better than expected UK unemployment and wages data. It is up 0.7%, a new peak since the Brexit vote but still below the $1.4878 level on the day of the referendum itself. Against the euro sterling is up 0.3% at \u20ac1.1416. The pound is benefitting from the signs of a stronger economy, and growing hopes that a Brexit deal can be reached. It is also being helped by the weakness of the dollar, which has fallen even more after the comments from US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at Davos. The US currency has been under pressure since the tax cuts announcement, with fears the reforms would push the country\u2019s huge deficit even higher. News of trade sanctions against South Korea and China have not helped, prompting fears of retaliation. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Sterling has bounced back in fine style, particularly against the dollar where it has climbed above $1.40 for the first time since the historic Brexit vote. Unemployment continues to fall, while there are signs that wages are finally growing, with employees willing to take more risks to ask for a pay rise, or even consider moving jobs. Although nothing has been decided yet, the general consensus is that the final version of Brexit could be softer than previously thought, which can only be good for the UK economy as a whole. NF Here\u2019s more details from former UK PM Tony Blair at Davos (speaking on Bloomberg TV) Asked whether there was any other way to avoid Brexit apart from having a second referendum, Blair said: \u201cYou could have a general election. \u201cIf we do go through with Brexit - and I hope we don\u2019t - it\u2019s going to be a complete change and we will have to fashion a new future for the country.\u201d He said that when people have clarity on what the Brexit deal might look like - and he suspects it will be \u201chotch potch\u201d - \u201cI think it will be very difficult to persuade people that\u2019s better than what we have now.\u201d Q: What is he expecting from Trump\u2019s speech on Friday? \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect. For me the issue is not responding to what Donald Trump has just said, it\u2019s the reasons that brought him to power ... the cultural and economic alienation ... this is the root of the problem that needs to be addressed.\u201d UK employment rose unexpectedly in the three months to November, while wages rose by a higher than forecast 2.4%, excluding bonuses. The number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the quarter, said the Office for National Statistics, the biggest increase since the three months to July. Analysts had expected a fall of 13,000. The unemployment rate was steady at a four decade low of 4.3%. As for wages, the 2.4% figure was up from 2.3% in the three months to October and better than the forecasts of a flat reading. With inflation slipping back from 3.1% to 3% in November, the wage gap has edged lower. Total pay growth including bonuses was steady at 2.5%, as forecast. NF While the German and French leaders are at Davos, there is some reasonable data from both countries. The latest manufacturing PMIs for the two have come in below expectations but the service sector has outperformed. For France the preliminary manufacturing PMI for January came in at 58.1, down from 58.8. The services PMI rose from 59.1 to 59.3, with the composite PMI up from 59.6 to 59.7. In Germany the manufacturing index fell from 63.3 to 61.2, the services rose from 55.8 to 57 but the composite slipped from 58.9 to 58.8 NF The US dollar is sliding like an ill-prepared delegate on the streets of Davos, thanks to Stephen Mnuchin. The Treasury secretary\u2019s comment about not being worried about the weak dollar has sparked another wave of selling, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. Former chancellor George Osborne says the vote for Brexit was \u201can alliance of the insulated and the insecure\u201d. In a discussion on the causes of Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory Osborne said the insulated were elderly voters who owned their homes outright but were anxious about the pace of change while the insecure were \u201con the margins of employment and looking for something to address their grievances.\u201d That was a classic good-cop/bad cop performance from Stephen Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross at Davos this morning. Mnuchin tried to calm concerns ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s visit, by insisting that America First wasn\u2019t incompatible with working with other countries. But Ross was more combative, insisting that America had been treated badly by other nations in the past, and that Trump is simply levelling the score. Ross comments about \u201cUS troops coming to the ramparts\u201d, and other countries talking about free trade but actually being protectionist, are a hint about how the US will behave behind the scenes at the World Economic Forum this week. Here\u2019s some reaction: Final question -- will the US be reassuring delegates at Davos that it isn\u2019t creating a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 on tax? Stephen Mnuchin replies that he\u2019s always been clear with fellow finance ministers that this isn\u2019t America\u2019s objective. This was about creating a comparable system for US companies to compete fairly, and we see that working. Q: What retaliations do you think China might take if the US imposes new tariffs? Every time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation, Wilbur Ross replies. To the degree that this happens, there\u2019s also a question about what the US would do next, Ross continues. Boom! Asked about the dangers of a trade war, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross argues that it has been underway for some time. The difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts. Stephen Mnuchin denies that there\u2019s a clash between America being \u2018open for business\u2019 and President Trump\u2019s economic goals. This is about an America First agenda, but America First does mean working with the rest of the world. President Trump is looking out for US workers and US interest, just as he\u2019d expect other world leaders to do, Mnuchin adds. Q: How concerned are you about the weakness of the US dollar? The dollar is one of the most liquid markets. Where it is in the short term is not a concern at all, says Mnuchin. A weaker US dollar is good for trade, he continues. And in the long term, the strength of the US dollar is a sign of the strength of the US economy. Q: Have you any evidence that your tax reforms are boosting investment? The vote from the market is \u2018pretty positive\u2019, Mnuchin replies. We\u2019ve seen many companies come out and commit hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, he says - citing Apple as an example. We couldn\u2019t be happier. The response from US businesses has been even better than we expected. Q: How does the America First economic agenda match up to the World Economic Forum\u2019s goals? Our objective is to be here to interact with our counterparts. That\u2019s very important for the world\u2019s biggest economy, Mnuchin replies. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in too, repeating that some of America\u2019s trading partners are protectionist, even if they talk about free trade. We don\u2019t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist. We think in fact it is essential to having markets operate properly, to have people play by the rules. Q: Are you worried that China might cut its holdings of US government debt? Treasury secretary Mnuchin says that some of the reporting of this issue has been inaccurate. The market for US treasuries is \u2018deep\u2019, he adds. Q: Is there a bubble in the United States financial markets? Mnuchin says that forums like Davos are never very good at predicting markets. What we see in the US markets is a reaction to the economic changes we\u2019ve made, he suggests - but he doesn\u2019t want to comment on other markets. As we look at US economic growth against the rest of the world, US economic growth looks very good - and it\u2019s a good place to invest, he continues. Q: What do you think about Justin Trudeau\u2019s comments about NAFTA yesterday? We totally believe in full and free trade - anyone who wants to do it on a reciprocal basis are very welcome, Stephen Mnuchin replies. Q: What might you do next against China over protectionism? Wilbur Ross: There are a number of other actions pending. Reports have been drawn up for President Trump to consider (he references the aluminium market) There will be a very busy trade agenda in terms of those actions by the US, and there are the formal actions with relation to NAFTA, Ross adds. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross speaks next, and rubbishes the idea that the US tax cuts are creating a new trade barrier This is a \u201cfunny concept\u201d, Ross says: The US has been on an uncompetitive model before, but it is now on a very competitive one. Ross also touches on free trade -- and insists that any actions taken by America are in response to \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d by America\u2019s trading partners. Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade, but actually practice protectionism. Stephen Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has just arrived at a packed-out press briefing here at Davos. He\u2019s accompanied by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Mnuchin begins by saying he\u2019s thrilled to be at Davos, with the largest US delegation to WEF ever. Obviously tax reforms and tax cuts were a major part of what we achieved in Donald Trump\u2019s first year, Mnuchin says - which will bring \u201cliterally trillions of dollars\u201d back to the UK. We are committed to achieving a 3% growth target, Mnuchin continued. And that\u2019s not just good for the US, it\u2019s good for the world economy too. Mnuchin declares: We are open for business, and we look forward to being here through the week. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in town! He just spoke to Bloomberg TV about the need for \u201cprogressive centerism\u201d. More on that later... The boss of Lloyds of London has warned that the focus on dry economic measures such as GDP has helped to create the backlash that led to Brexit. Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum, Inga Beale said policymakers need to think differently about how they measure the economy. Beale explained: I do remember, when we were going through the campaigning around Brexit, in the UK, we, as businesses, were talking about GDP. Most of the members of the public don\u2019t even know what that means, you know, they-, it doesn\u2019t relate to them. And there\u2019s a definite feeling that they\u2019re not being included, and they want to challenge the, you know, the \u2018as is\u2019, at the moment. They really want to go out and say, \u2018I\u2019m not happy with this status quo. You\u2019re not hearing me. You\u2019re not respecting me. I\u2019m not included.\u2019 And when we talk about GDP, that doesn\u2019t feel very inclusive for them. On Monday, the World Economic Forum did launch a new, more inclusive measure of economic performance that also tracked inequality and sustainability. Britain came just 21st. Sounds like Emmanuel Macron is only paying a flying visit.. Last night, around 2000 demonstrators in Zurich marched in protest at Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the World Economic Forum. Reuters reports that a small group even managed to demonstrate here in Davos: About 20 demonstrators broke through security to reach the Davos Congress Centre, holding banners and shouting \u201cWipe out WEF\u201d before they were peacefully disbanded by police. \u201cTrump is just one of the other people we disagree with. We\u2019ve been protesting every year now against the World Economic Forum and if Trump comes or not we don\u2019t care. Trump is just, maybe he\u2019s just the best symbol of this world,\u201d protester Alex Hedinger told Reuters TV in Davos. More here. Now this is interesting.... Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is going to give a briefing at Davos in around 30 minutes. Today\u2019s meeting is billed \u201cWe are open for business\u201d - perhaps an attempt to calm worries over President Trump\u2019s America First agenda.... Good morning. The second day of the World Economic is getting underway, with a strong European flavour. German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni are all due on the Davos main stage today - a chance to set the agenda before Donald Trump\u2019s eagerly-awaited speech on Friday. But the Americans are already fighting for the spotlight. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is in town, and speaking to the press this morning (we\u2019ll hopefully have more on that soon). Spain\u2019s King Filipe, and the presidents of Brazil and Zimbabwe are also making appearances. Plus, Davos delegates will be discussing economic inequality (despite the obvious irony), slavery, and the opportunity and threats posed by technology. There\u2019s even a footballer in town. Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata will be pushing his Common Goal charitable fund, which encourages sports stars to donate some of their massive salaries to good causes. Here\u2019s some of the events we\u2019ll try to cover: 10am Davos (9am GMT): IMF chief Christine Lagarde on \u201cSolving the Economic Generation Gap\u201d 10.20am Davos (9.20am GMT): Special Address by Michel Temer, President of Brazil 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI speaks 12.30pm Davos (11.30am GMT): Session on \u2018Stabilizing the Mediterranean\u2019 with Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni and Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa speaks 2.20pm Davos (1.20pm GMT): Special Address by Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on AI and technology\u2019s impact on society 4pm Davos (3pm GMT): A session on how to end slavery 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Special Address by Emmanuel Macron, President of France 6pm Davos (5pm GMT): Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata talks about his Common Goal charitable work",

The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes.</p> <p>And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment?</p> </blockquote> <p>So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels.

The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors.</p> <p>Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high.</p> <p>With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018.

The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter.</p> <p>Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January.</p> <p>And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u2019 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist.</p> <p>Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour.

Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cBusiness finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. </p> <p>\u201cOur estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u201d Behravesh says.</p> <p>There are two risks, he adds. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up.</p> <p>If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. </p> <p>\u201cSo far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> \u201cBut I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year.

          "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap of the main events from the first day of Davos: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has challenged business leaders and politicians to end gender inequality and tackle unacceptable and systemic sexual harassment. You can watch a clip here. Trudeau also announced that the ten members of the trans-pacific partnership have agreed to extend their agreement. Oxfam\u2019s Winnie Byanyima has also hailed campaigners against sexual harrassment, saying they have helped people worldwide. Davos also heard that parents need to teach their sons not to hit women, rather than simply how to hit baseballs. India\u2019s Narendra Modi has warned that globalisation is under threat, and also cited climate change and terrorism as key threats to the global economy. The mood at Davos has been optimistic, although bank bosses have warned against complacency. An MIT economics professor has predicted that Facebook will barely exist in 20 years. Australian actor Cate Blanchett has criticised politicians for pandering to anti-refugee sentiment, instead of helping the millions of people displaced worldwide. That\u2019s probably all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW A positive start following news that the US government shutdown had been resolved, for the moment at least, soon faded, leaving European markets a mixed bag by the close. Sterling rose above $1.40 to a new post-Brexit vote high, partly due to hopes that a successful trade deal can be negotiated, but also thanks to continuing weakness in the dollar. The US currency has been under pressure on worries that the Trump tax cuts would increase the already hefty US national debt. And the dollar has become less attractive as other central banks begin edging up interest rates and gradually removing their long standing stimulus programmes. And despite a resolution to the government shutdown, the problem has only been postponed until early next month. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Renewed dollar weakness is the revival of yet another familiar friend from 2017. Post-shutdown euphoria has been replaced by a weary acceptance that we will probably have to do this all over again in just over two weeks. Why buy the greenback, when so many other economies can show solid growth without the government disruption so prevalent in the US at the moment? So with the stronger pound, the FTSE 100 came off its best levels. But Germany\u2019s Dax hovered around record levels, following upbeat consumer confidence figures and signs that a coalition government could be moving closer. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated between positive and negative, but Nasdaq was lifted by the positive Netflix update. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 16.39 points or 0.21% at 7731.83 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.71% to 13,559.60 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.12% at 5535.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.22% to 23,836.60 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.24% at 10,609.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.62% to 872.00 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 28 points or 0.11%. NF Here\u2019s a video clip of Justin Trudeau laying down the law on sexual harassment: Justin Trudeau\u2019s speech has caused quite a stir, with its trenchant criticism of greedy, uncaring businesses and gender inequality. Adam Parsons of the BBC thinks it was a punchy speech: John Stackhouse of Royal Bank of Canada says Trudeau is shaking up the idea of what \u2018Davos Man\u2019 acts like: Ian Bremmer says Trudeau showed how gender equality is an important economic issue: But Jamie Drummond of campaigning group One isn\u2019t convinced Trudeau will deliver: Justin Trudeau also made an important point about trade. He tells Davos that Canada is trying to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the NAFTA trade agreement was in the interest of the United States as well as other countries. Trudeau says: \u201cWe\u2019re working very hard to make sure that our neighbour to the south recognizes how good NAFTA is and that it has benefited not just our economy but his economy and the world economy,\u201d Justin Trudeau moves onto another vital issue - campaigns such as #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up. The Canadian PM declares: These movements show us we must have a critical discussion on women\u2019s rights, equality and the power dynamics of gender. Sexual harassment in business and in government is a systemic problem and it is unacceptable. As leaders, we must recognise and act to truly show that time is up. Justin Trudeau now urges business chiefs at Davos to help fight inequality by hiring, promoting and retaining more women. Getting more women into the workforce isn\u2019t just the right thing to do, or the nice thing to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do, he tells the World Economic Forum, Studies show it can provide a significant economic boost. Firms need to address gender pay, and he warns that many firms aren\u2019t doing as well as they think. Just paying men and women the same doesn\u2019t go far enough, unless you also tackle the barriers faced by female workers. Women do more part-time work, and more unpaid work than men. Parental leave and childcare policies must be reexamined, Trudeau tells WEF. Firms should implement policies to improve gender balance. He also reminds us that he introduced Canada\u2019s first gender-balanced cabinet, and the performance of those female ministers has proved the naysayers wrong. Justin Trudeau has warned that businesses and politicians are failing to help their workers and citizens in today\u2019s \u201crapidly changing world\u201d. People have been taken advantage of, losing their jobs, the Canadian PM warns: Governments and corporations, we haven\u2019t done enough to address this. He also blasts corporate greed, saying: Too many corporations have single-mindedly put the pursuit of profit ahead of the well-being of workers. The gap between the rich and the poor is staggering, Trudeau points out, adding All the while, companies avoid taxes and boast record profits with one hand while slashing benefits with the other. Our priority must be the people who are struggling the most, and who will never get to Davos, Trudeau says. And he warns that if we operate on the basis of business as usual, \u201cthe system will break down and we will all fail.\u201d Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is now speaking to Davos. He begins by thanking the seven all-female co-chairs for organising this year\u2019s WEF. He then makes an important announcement: The 10 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have concluded a new agreement that will maintain their alliance. The agreement reached today in Tokyo is the right deal, Trudeau insists. It will create growth, prosperity, and middle class jobs in Canada today and for generations. This is significant, as Donald Trump pulled the US out of the TPP. In an hour\u2019s time, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will give a special address to the World Economic Forum. As a liberal, feminist leader, Trudeau is a Davos favourite. But that shouldn\u2019t mean he gets a free pass. Jamie Drummond, executive director of the development group One, says that Trudeau isn\u2019t actually delivering on pledges to make the world a better place. As Drummond puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s so exasperating that prime minister Justin Trudeau will make another great speech today while the facts point in a shocking direction. Smart aid rates under Trudeau are lower than under his conservative predecessor Stephen Harper, the money he loudly promised would be new to fight aids, TB and malaria was in fact not new, and his feminist foreign policy is not backed by new funds. This can and must change now. Not in 2020, or some vague theoretical far-off point after the next election. Drummond urges WEF delegates to put Trudeau under pressure to deliver. This week in Davos he must be asked when and by specifically how much he will increase funding for girls education and women\u2019s economic empowerment; and please, he must do it this year. If we want him be a great leader on these issues, we must withhold praise until we see the quality of his action not just his delightful adverbs. Trust Trudeau - but verify. And if Davos doesn\u2019t pressure leaders like Trudeau to be the best they can be, or hold them accountable, this gathering is a self-defeating backslapping waste of time the world doesn\u2019t have.\u201d As we reported this morning, Drummond is threatening not to come back to Davos unless this annual shindig starts delivering the goods. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is among the world leaders who have lined up to get to Davos, reports Helena Smith from Athens: Tsipras, who arrived only hours after Athens wrapped up a third bailout compliance review \u2013 edging ever closer to ending dependence on international bailout loans when the programme expires this summer - is meeting investors also gathered in Davos. The leftist\u2013led government, in an about\u2013turn of its previous antagonism, is now keen to attract foreign capital as it prepares the country\u2019s return to capital markets. This afternoon\u2019s meeting is much in the vein of luring investors to fund projects in Greece with an eye to slashing unemployment \u2013 at 21% still the highest in the EU and by far the nation\u2019s biggest social ill. Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting saw euro area finance ministers agreeing to disburse \u20ac6.7bn to the debt -stricken nation in two instalments. The first chunk of \u20ac5.7bn will be released in February, once outstanding reforms are implemented, to cover debt servicing needs, arrears and creation of a cash buffer that will support Greece\u2019s return to markets. Talks on debt relief are expected to begin soon \u2013 along with a fourth compliance review which included 88 creditor-mandates reforms being taken by June. Sounding a note of optimism, EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the single currency bloc should prepare for \u201ca successful conclusion, which means Greece being back as a normal member of the eurozone and the final signal \u2013 the end of the Greek crisis.\u201d After the better than expected German consumer confidence figures, there is more positive news from Europe. Eurozone consumer confidence rose from 0.5 points in December to 1.3 points in January, according to the European Commission. This was well above forecasts of a figure of 0.6. In the wide European Union, confidence jumped 1 point to 0.4 points. ING economist Bert Colijn said: With inflation still low, job growth surprising on the upside, house prices increasing and growth forecasts adjusted upwards, there is a lot to like for consumers and that\u2019s evident. The current mood among consumers is nothing short of ecstatic and current levels of confidence are generally associated with further acceleration in household consumption growth. Uncertainty about possible Eurozone reform, Italian elections and the success of the German coalition negotiations clearly take a backseat to improved economic factors. Over the past few months, consumer confidence improved most notably because of a much more positive view on the general economic situation, modest improvements in assessments of the financial situation and increased amounts of current and expected major purchases. This indicates that optimism and stronger consumption are going hand in hand, spurring the household consumption component of GDP growth. While unemployment expectations have become slightly less favourable over the last months of 2017, this is actually at odds with businesses indicating that hiring expectations remain very high. With such a favourable outlook, it could well be that the record for consumer confidence could be breached a few more times in 2018. This, in turn, confirms the rosy short-term picture for Eurozone growth. NF Dacher Keltner, Professor of Psychology from the University of California, is also on the sexual harassment panel alongside Winnie Byanyima. He says: Men tend to take more risks, they tend to be a lot more aggressive, and they tend to sexualise thing. So if you give a man power, those default tendencies will be expressed. Women tend to be more collaborative, co-operative, empathetic. You give them power, studies show it will amplify those pro-social tendencies. Lisa Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Advertising Council, says parents can do more to help boys treat women with respect. You teach your son how to hit a baseball, how to hit a jump shot, how to hit the net. But we should really be talking to them about who not to hit, and why. Peggy Johnson, executive Vice-President for Business Development at Microsoft, says the younger generation are helping to force change. She explains that her daughter recently started her career, and told her that \u2018when there\u2019s an inappropriate joke at work, I don\u2019t laugh\u2019. I thought back and thought, when I was her age I always laughed, says Johnson. My daughter said to me that she\u2019d learned not to laugh at these jokes from me, but she actually learned it from me in my 50s, not my 20s. Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of Oxfam International, is speaking powerfully about sexual exploitation against women around the globe. All the women in the world should be grateful to American women for taking a stand, and saying \u201cMe Too\u201d, Byanyima says, referring to the campaign that spread around the globe after the Harvey Weinstein scandal. It has brought new attention to a problem that is deep. Women in the developing world are at the bottom of the supply chain of big business. Oxfam hears stories of their lives, Byanyima explains, such as hotel housekeepers. All of them told us that they had faced sexual harassment or knew someone who had faced sexual harassment. It goes on with impunity. Domestic workers globally suffer abuse, she continues, and some of them are like slaves in the homes where they work. Only a few countries have ratified a new convention for domestic workers. It is not an accident that women are abused sexually at work or at home. It\u2019s due to the social norms that are there to justify their economic exploitation. That is why it is so important to tackle economic inequality, as this will also help tackle violence against women. Byanyima says there are three ways to tackle this problem: Remove all the laws that discriminate against women in the economy Tackle the social norms that justify sexual exploitation. Businesses have an important role to play here - they can use their factories, supply chains, advertising. Unilever are doing it, so others can too. Bring women into every level of decision-making and leadership, so they can drive change. In the wake of the resolution to the US government shutdown, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was initially expected to open higher. But when trading began the Dow dipped 27 points or 0.1%, with investors moving on to worry about the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s move to impose steep import tariffs, including possible retaliation. South Korea and China both protested at the duties on washing machines and solar panels. The S&amp;P 500 however edged up 0.03% and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.23%. The uncertainty has taken some of the shine off European shares, with the FTSE 100 now up just 0.11% and France\u2019s Cac virtually unchanged. Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 0.76%, off its best levels. NF David Autor, Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, has predicted that today\u2019s giant tech companies - such as Facebook - will suffer the face of previous dominant companies. He\u2019s on a panel asking \u2018can we live with monopolies\u2019. Autor explains that we currently live in an environment of \u2018winner takes most\u2019 markets, where having a small edge over your competitor gives you a massive advantage. So firms like Amazon and Facebook are growing organically (people are on Facebook because their friends are on Facebook), but that doesn\u2019t mean that this growth is healthy. Or sustainable, in the long run. We did have these monopolies in the past, Autor points out, citing the US railroads, and AT&amp;T which was broken up by regulators. Also, companies which appear indomitable can fade pretty fast, he says - and then makes a bold prediction: I would guess that Facebook will be almost non-existent 20 years from now. Autor is also critical of the US model where employees are not treated as stakeholders (unlike shareholders). This situation has created a level of inequality that has led to political upheaval, he says. Elsewhere in Davos, the head of the Red Cross has warned that fresh humanitarian crises could break out this year. Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, says there are a lot of fragile situations that could develop into \u201cfull-fledged\u201d conflicts (as we saw with the Rohingya crisis in 2017). Maurer says there are plenty of places on the brink of war, violence and disruption. He cites Southern Philippines (which is under martial law), Myanmar, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa as places where the Red Cross sees fragility - but \u201cwe don\u2019t know which one will blow up in our face\u201d. So what can Davos do about it? Top business leaders have the skills and resources to help businesses in those fragile areas, and help them tipping into conflict. Maurer also warns that humanitarian organisations need more money: In 2018 we face a big gap between the needs of people and the capacity of the international system as a whole to respond. The gap can only be bridged by more and better finance. Ultimately, Blanchett says, we must remember we are all citizens, and stand up for what we believe in. Cate Blanchett is close to tears, as she talks about one refugee family she met in Jordan. They had fled conflict with five of their children, being shot at by all sides. Eventually, the father had to choose between carrying his suitcases and carrying his children (he chose the children). No-one should be put in that position, she says. Q: Aren\u2019t politicians taking a hard line on refugees because they are reacting to the concerns of their populations? Cate Blanchett argues that they\u2019re actually reacting to populist media and the news cycle. We are at a fork in the road, she says. We try to teach our children to be compassionate, to be tolerant, to accept diversity, to share. But all the structures that are around them are not doing the same, so it\u2019s quite a schizophrenic world they\u2019re living in. And taking a swing at populist politicians, she says she don\u2019t understand how turning people in a boat back became an election winner. Australian actor Cate Blanchett is talking about the refugee crisis now (yesterday she was handed a WEF award for her work on this issue). She explains how she went backpacking through Europe in her youth, which opened her eyes to economic inequality. I was staying in youth hostels that were more like Turkish prisons, She explains, seeing people who didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go Q: There\u2019s been a lot of criticism of Australia\u2019s policy to refugees.... Blanchett says she was \u2018bewildered\u2019 to see the generous, openhearted, multi-cultural Australia she grew up in \u201cflouting the UN humans rights convention\u201d I was very distressed that Australia was reverting back to practices that made us a fortress again. This drove Blanchett to become a goodwill ambassador to UNHCR I think it\u2019s shameful. There\u2019s so much misinformation about refugees. They are forced to flee, and then they are vilified in the media. Blanchett says the misinformation about refugees is \u201cvery distressing\u201d, and doesn\u2019t connect with the actual people she has met. There are 65 million displaced people in the world, 22 million are refugees, half are women and children. But just 1% have been resettled in advanced developed economies. It\u2019s the developing world that is shouldering the deep burden of refugees. She cites the Lebanon, where a quarter of the population are now refugees. Blanchett also criticises the way refugees are reported in the media: People are told this narrative that these people, who have so much to offer, are going to be a burden on us or become a terrorist threat. Q: But have some people in developing economies been encouraged to travel to countries such as Germany, because they hoped to be given asylum? Should we not talk about it, Blanchett replies rhetorically. The problem is not going to go away. These are not terrorists. These are innocent people, who want to return home. She\u2019s also calling for more burden-sharing between countries, to help address the refugee crisis. The problem with all this optimism at Davos is that business leaders, economists and politicians have a nasty habit of missing impending disaster. WEF veterans point out that the mood is often particularly upbeat shortly before a crisis. Barclays CEO Jes Staley summed it up this morning, on the financial crisis session when he said Davos feels \u201ca little bit like 2006 when we were all talking whether we\u2019ve solved the riddle of economic crises.\u201d The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein agreed, saying: Generally, when people are happy and confident, something wrong happens. Back with the UK public finances, and a Treasury spokesperson said: We have made great progress in reducing the deficit by three quarters since 2010, but government debt is still far too high. Our balanced approach to government spending is getting debt falling, while investing in key public services and keeping taxes low. And the Office for Budget Responsibility said: It appears that the underlying improvement in borrowing so far this year is a little faster than would be consistent with our November forecast. NF Christoph Franz, the chairman of Roche, agrees that spirits are high at Davos this year - and with good reason. Speaking to CNBC, Frans argues that \u2018healthy\u2019 economic growth is boosting optimism among top execs. Basically, I have been here for more than ten years, I share your perspective, there\u2019s a very positive mood right now among business leaders here in Davos, and I think the reason is, we see a growth perspective in, not only some specific countries, but on a global scale, and the growth is achieving numbers which we have seen only before 2007. So, the economy is taking up, and for the time being, it is growth which has been created by a lot of investment. Britain\u2019s manufacturers continue to be optimistic about business prospects and exports, but are increasingly worried about skills shortages. The CBI\u2019s latest industrial trends survey for the three months to January showed 27% of firms were more optimistic about the general business situation that three months ago, while 14% were less optimistic. The balance of +13% is up from -11% in the previous quarter. Growth in manufacturing output and domestic and export orders all picked up, compared with the previous three-month period, although the monthly order book figure showed a fall from +17 in December to +14 in January. And the number of firms saying a lack of skilled labour was likely to limit output over the next three months was the highest for more than four decades. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: It\u2019s good to see manufacturing going from strength-to-strength with growth up and the buoyant global economy boosting export orders. But the past depreciation in Sterling continues to leave its mark on firms\u2019 costs and margins. With expectations for factory gate price inflation at their highest in 30 years, the pressure on consumer prices looks set to persist. Capacity pressures are ramping up and skill shortages are a big concern, underlining the importance of establishing a future immigration system that provides companies with access to talent and labour. The building blocks of a new system that meets economic needs and public concerns must start with scrapping the net migration target, which has never been fit-for-purpose. NF Yup. Modi wraps up his speech by identifying three priorities: The world economy must be more inclusive Policymakers must remain committed to a rules-based world order Reforming the major institutions of the world, connected to politics, the economy and securtry He talks about the Indian soldiers who died in world wars in the 20th century, to help create \u201cpeace and humanity\u201d. India can be a humanising and harmonising force in an uncertain world, Modi promises, citing Indian prayers and poetry which advocates a free and peaceful world. Together we can create a \u2018heaven of future\u2019, he promises, in a somewhat gushing conclusion. Alas, he\u2019s not taking any questions. On climate change, Modi says India is making big progress towards hitting its goals for renewable energy. Modi says India will achieve strong growth over the next few years. Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch suggests Modi isn\u2019t living up to the glowing ideals he\u2019s preaching today: (remember, Modi was once banned from visiting the US following claims he had supported Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots. He was later cleared by the Indian Supreme Court). Modi is now encouraging businesses to invest in India, citing the hundreds of laws and regulations which have been stripped out to make te economy more competitive. Instead of red tape, we offer you a red carpet, he jokes. Democracy isn\u2019t just a political system, says Modi - it is a life view and a lifestyle. He cites India\u2019s proud democracy and diversity, declaring: For a society with diverse religions, cultures, languages, attires and cuisines, democracy is not just a political system but a way of living: Thirdly, the world is threatened by the rising attacks on globalisation, says Modi. We must accept that globalisation is slowly losing its lustre, he says. And he pits some of the blame on the institutions created after world war 2, such as the United Nations. Do the structures and action plans of these organisations match the aspirations and dreams of mankind, Modi asks rhetorically. Then he takes aim at protectionism, saying: Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation. They want to reverse its flow. The world risks new tariff and non-tariff barriers, he continues, cautioning that \u201cbilateral and multilateral trade negotiations have come to a kind of standstill\u2019. The second major threat is terrorism, Modi continues. He says there is an artificial distinction between \u2018good and bad\u2019 terrorism, and a worrying radicalism of young people. The world has moved from needs-based to greed-based consumption, says Modi seriously. This does not live up to the ideals of Gandhi, or the teaching of Buddha. Modi cites climate change as a major threat. Glaciers are melting, islands are disappearing under the sea, and in Davos we have the worst snow in 20 years, he says. And he criticises the leaders of advanced economies for not showing more solidarity Everyone talks about reducing climate emissions, but there are very few countries who back their words with their resources to help developing countries to adopt appropriate technology. Very few of them come forward to help. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Modi\u2019s call for co-operation to build a better future, rather than descending into isolationism. Narendra Modi now turns to the \u201cfractures\u201d in the global economy, citing unemployment, inequality, lack of opportunities. Some important questions come to mind, which require answers, he says. Is our global order widening these fault lines, increasing these differences, and giving preference to isolationism over harmony and conflict over co-operation, he asks, adding: What paths can we follow, to eliminate rifts and differences. How can we realise the dream of a beautiful shared future. Modi is speaking in Hindi, incidentally, so the audience are getting a realtime translation. Today, data is the world\u2019s biggest asset, Modi declares. We are accumulating mountains and mountains of data, he continues. There is now a race to control data, because it is believes that whoever is able to control the data can dominate the world. Narendra Modi takes the stage, to another round of applause. He begins with a history lesson. The last time an Indian PM was at Davos was in 1997, when H. D. Deve Gowda visited. Back then, India\u2019s GDP was $400bn - it is now six times larger. WEF\u2019s theme in 1997 was \u2018building the networked society\u2019. Today, it is not just a networked society. We are living in the world of big data, artificial intelligence and robots. Back in 1997, Modi continues the eurozone didn\u2019t exist, the Asian financial crisis wasn\u2019t expected, and there was no sign that Brexit might happen. Very few people had heard of Osama Bin Laden, and Harry Potter was also an unknown name. Back then, Google didn\u2019t exist, a web search for Amazon would bring up a river or jungle, and tweeting was done by birds, Modi declares. Davos\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, is introducing Narendra Modi now. Globally we are moving to a multipolar, and multi-conceptual world, says Schwab. In a seemingly fractured world, India presents a bright image of optimism, he adds. It also presents an investment opportunity (something that business leaders at Davos will be interested in) There\u2019s a buzz on the floor of the World Economic Forum as India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi prepares to give the opening speech. Modi is a big draw - the main hall is filling up fast with delegates keen to hear his words. The speech should be streamed live here: Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit says the mood at Davos is very different this year than in 2017. He tells us: \u201cIt is a lot more optimistic and the optimism is broad based. Last year the Americans were upbeat but the Europeans were gloomy. A year ago the feeling was that politics was going to overwhelm economics but the opposite has happened. An improving economy may make populism less compelling\u201d Behravesh says that Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House a year ago led to an increase in business confidence. Corporate America was not keen on Barack Obama, he says. \u201cBusiness finally got a president it thought was business friendly and the reduction in regulation has been received well.\u201d Business also likes the package of tax cuts Trump finally pushed through Congress at the end of 2017 and which are weighted in favour of the well off and corporations. \u201cOur estimate is that the tax cuts will add 0.3 percentage points to growth in 2018, 2019 and 2020\u201d Behravesh says. There are two risks, he adds. \u201cThe US and global economy may be running too hot. We think unemployment in the US will go as low as 3.5%, which is well below estimates of full employment. The question is how soon wage inflation and price inflation picks up. If inflation surprises on the upside we could see the Federal Reserve and other central banks step on the brakes a lot harder. The stock market could take a hit and that would be bad.\u201d The other risk is that Trump starts making good on his protectionist threats. \u201cSo far his bark has been worse then his bite, Behravesh says. \u201cBut I think China is going to come under a lot of pressure from the US this year. The US is very unhappy about the China\u2019s unwillingness to toe the line on intellectual property.\u201d Over in Germany, consumer confidence remains strong. The ZEW institute economic sentiment index came in at 20.4 points in January, up from 17.4 the previous month and better than the forecasts of a reading of 17.8. And this came amid uncertainty over the country\u2019s political future and before the weekend\u2019s agreement to take another step towards a coalition government. The index remains slightly below the long-term average of 23.7 points, but it is still a positive outcome. Meanwhile the current conditions index rose from 89.3 points o 95.2. ZEW president professor Achim Wambach said: The latest survey results reveal an optimistic outlook for the German economy in the first six months of 2018. With 95.2 out of 100 points, this is the most positive assessment of the current economic situation since the introduction of the survey in December 1991. Private consumption, which was the most important driver of economic growth in 2017, is likely to continue to stimulate growth in the coming six months according to the survey participants. The assessment of the global economic environment in Europe and the USA is also much more favourable than it was at the end of 2017. NF Despite the warnings from Davos, investors are pushing markets higher again this morning. There is renewed confidence following the IMF raising its growth forecasts on Monday (albeit not for the UK), as well as relief that the US government shutdown has been resolved, at least for another couple of weeks. Meanwhile there were no surprises from the Bank of Japan, which recently unnerved markets by reducing its monthly bond buying programme by $10bn. This time it left monetary policy unchanged. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.31%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.11% and Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.86% better and at new highs. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It\u2019s taken a while for the DAX to join in with the all-time high hitting performances of the FTSE and the Dow Jones seen in 2018. However, with German coalition talks steadily moving along, a stop-gap deal to end the US government shutdown, and a subsequent pullback from the euro against the dollar, the bourse seems ready to bulge, shooting up by 130 points to tease a 13600 record peak. In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which jumped 142 points or 0.55% after the news of the impasse over the government shutdown had been resolved, is expected to open 84 points higher. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: The FTSE bounced on the open this morning, following a record session in the US overnight. The Dow surged over 140 points, whilst the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq tagged on 0.8% and 1% respectively, all hitting unchartered territory. The rally took place after the Democrats and the Republicans passed the funding bill to end the US government shut down, 72 hours after it started. NF Britain\u2019s budget deficit came in much better than expected, giving a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Thanks to an unusually large credit from the European Union and the strongest VAT receipts on record, public sector net borrowing fell from \u00a38.25bn in November to \u00a32.6bn last month. This was well below analyst forecasts of a figure of around \u00a35bn. There was a \u00a31.2bn credit from the EU related to the region\u2019s smaller than expected overall budget and improved economic performance. With the UK economy holding up despite Brexit vote fears, VAT receipts rose by an annual 4.8% to a record \u00a312.3bn. Total public borrowing since last April is now \u00a350bn, 12% less than in the same period in 2016 and leaving Hammond on track to meet his full year target of \u00a349.9bn by the end of March. NF More highlights from the Davos talk about financial risks: Anne Richards, chief executive of M&amp;G Investments, fears that a devastating IT crash could cause the next financial crisis. She tells an audience in Davos that policymakers risk ignoring the threat posed by investors\u2019 reliance on technology, and the damage that could be caused if key systems go down. Richards says she doesn\u2019t buy the argument that a geopolitical crisis will bring the bull market crashing down. After all, markets handle geopolitical events all the time. Instead, she fears that the \u201csystemic risk\u201d posed by new technology, and the cloud, could provoke an event that changes the \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the markets today. Richards warns: We all have businesses that are absolutely reliant on a very small number of people who provide the pipes that we put our business though. There\u2019s a technology thing out there that we\u2019re all somewhat blind to. It would be interesting to think how markets would react if none of us could trade for one, or two or three days\u201d David Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of The Carlyle Group, is also on the panel. He\u2019s more worried about political threats - predicting that if there is a geopolitical crisis, markets will be hurt and firms will pull back from capital investment. This year\u2019s World Economic Forum is being led by an all-female group of co-chairs. They\u2019re giving a press conference now: Erna Solberg, prime minister of Norway, is speaking now - calling for a new crackdown on illegal finance and corruption. Solberg says this is fuelling terrorism and security threats, and making it harder for emerging economies to develop their economies. She suggests a MeToo campaign to fight corruption is needed: We need to see who is taking money, who is bribing others, and show that this is unacceptable in all our societies. Solberg\u2019s other priority is gender equality -- she warns that women are still treated unfairly in many economies. The barriers to women\u2019s participation [in the labour market] is still large in many societies - it doesn\u2019t make sense economically or politically. Can Emmanuel Macron really succeed where his predecessors failed, and reform the French economy? Tidjane Thiam, the boss of Credit Suisse, says the answer is a resounding yes. Speaking on a panel about \u2018global markets in a fractured world\u2019, Thaim says Macron\u2019s programme of labour market reforms would have led to \u201ccertain electoral defeat\u201d 20 years ago - not last year\u2019s triumph against Marine Le Pen. As Thiam puts it: Macron only got elected because the French public, the French nation, decided to change. That\u2019s how it works in a democracy. Political scientist Ian Bremmer agrees that market sentiment and political reality have got out of whack.... The usual high security measures are in place in Davos this morning. Armed guards prevent any non-delegates getting into WEF; even if you\u2019re accredited, you have to negotiate airport-style security before you\u2019re actually allowed in. The snowdrifts have also provided a new reason to ban protests in Davos this week. Davos officials say \u201cthe extremely tight space situation due to the enormous amount of new snow\u201d doesn\u2019t leave any space for a rally.... UBS\u2019s chairman, Axel Weber, has warned that sentiment in the market is \u201ctoo buoyant\u201d. Speaking on CNBC this morning, Weber said there was a worrying gap between investor optimism and the actual state of the economy. Investors are taking risks, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting adequate compensation for those risks. At some time, if it\u2019s got to stop it\u2019s got to stop. He added that the markets could be in a more difficult position by the time of Davos 2019.... Justin Trudeau says he\u2019ll be batting for middle-class Canadians in Davos this week. His speech this afternoon is also expected to cover corporate responsibility and the role of women in a changing world. Davos regular Jamie Drummond says he may not come back, unless this year\u2019s meeting makes real progress towards tackling inequality. Drummond is the executive director of the development group One, which he co-founded with the rock star Bono. In a blog, Drummond said he had been stung by the accusation that he had spent so long hobnobbing with the 1% that he was becoming a \u201cDavos man.\u201d \u201cA feminist activist, and someone I deeply respect, recently commented that I was at risk of becoming that awful thing: \u2018a Davos Man\u2019. Definitions vary but this phrase generally refers to a male who goes to places like Davos and inhabits an elite, unaccountable bubble while determining the fates of those without access to it. The comment cut deep. It forced me to question any complicity I might have in a system I have tried so hard to change. So I\u2019m putting my inner Davos Man on notice, and making this commitment: this will be my last World Economic Forum unless this one helps deliver on three crucial areas in the fight against extreme poverty and gender inequality. Those areas are the global education emergency; women\u2019s economic empowerment; and ambitious financing to back Africa\u2019s huge youth boom.\u201d Philip Jennings, head of the global union UNI, has been one of the strongest voices for labour at Davos for many a year but 2018 will be his last meeting before retiring in the summer. Speaking to the Guardian, Jennings said the current business model built on the principle of shareholder value was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d and that the opportunity provided by the financial crisis of a decade ago to build a more inclusive economy has been squandered. \u201cDonald Trump is Mr Shareholder value\u201d, Jennings said, adding: \u201cHe is exhibit A of the fractured world\u201d. Jennings said a test for the business leaders in Davos talking about the problems of global inequality was whether they recognised trade unions and collective bargaining at their firms. And he predicted a backlash against three of the new titans of the global economy: Amazon, Facebook and Google. \u201cThese companies were once seen as angelic, seen as our saviours\u201d, Jennings said. \u201cBut the big three has such market influence and power that the world has to wake up and start thinking about the need for anti-trust action. One of the fractures in the global economy is the power of the new monopolies and the danger it represents\u201d. The huge snowfalls in Davos recently mean the ski resort is now facing a Level 5 avalanche risk - the highest rating. Some homes have reportedly been evacuated, due to fears that the snow is too unstable. There has already been big delays getting up the mountain (someone I met last night spent six hours crawling here from Zurich), leading to plenty of chuntering among delegates. Davos has had an early wake-up call. PR chief Richard Edelman\u2019s annual trust index shows that Americans have become much less trusting of politicians, business chiefs and the media over the last year. He says: No country saw steeper declines than the United States, with a 37-point aggregate drop in trust across all institutions. At the opposite end of the spectrum, China experienced a 27-point gain, more than any other country. The survey shows that people are more worried about the rise of disinformation -- and finding it hard to separate truth from \u2018fake news\u2019 So, genuine voices of expertise are now regaining credibility. Edelman explains: Journalists have risen 12 points, and CEOs recorded a seven-percentage point gain, since 2017. Good morning from Davos! World leaders, business chiefs, trade unions, the heads of charities and NGOs, celebrities and the media are gathering in this small ski resort to discuss the state of the world, and how to improve it. This year\u2019s WEF is taking place amid the biggest snowfalls in many years. This is already leading to inequality on the streets of Davos: workers are furiously shovelling drifts aside and driving snowploughs as the global elite queue bumper-to-bumper to reach the WEF congress centre and the exclusive hotels and converted shops where events are taking place. Last night, Pope Francis set the mood by issuing a stern warning not to remain silent in the face of economic inequality and injustice. In a message read to the Davos attendees, the Pope warned not to allow people to be used as cogs in a machine and then chucked aside. He declared: \u201cNew actors are emerging, as well as new economic competition and regional trade agreements. Even the most recent technologies are transforming economic models and the globalized world itself, which, conditioned by private interests and an ambition for profit at all costs, seem to favour further fragmentation and individualism, rather than to facilitate approaches that are more inclusive,\u201d Even Sir Elton John weighed in, describing inequality in the world today as \u2018disgraceful\u2019 (as we covered in last night\u2019s blog). Two world leaders will address Davos today, with different priorities. Narendra Modi, who gives the opening speech, is the first Indian prime minister to visit WEF in 20 years. He\u2019s on a big push to attract more business to his country, billing India as a key growth engine for the global economy. India have sent a large delegation to Davos this year - many of whom found themselves caught up in the transport chaos yesterday. Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau is expected to pitch at business leaders. But his speech, this afternoon, may also cover weightier issues such as women\u2019s empowerment. There\u2019s loads of other stuff coming up too, including debates on the financial markets, capitalism, and sexual harassment. The agenda: 9.30am Davos (8.30am GMT): Opening press conference by the Davos co-chairs 9.45am Davos (8.45am GMT): Debate: Are we heading for a new financial crisis? 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Indian PM Narendra Modi gives the opening plenary speech 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Actor Cate Blanchett speaks about the global refugee crisis 3pm Davos (2pm GMT): Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan talks about women\u2019s empowerment in India. 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Debate on gender, power and sexual harassment 5pm Davos (4pm GMT): Debate on capitalism: 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Canadian PM Justin Trudeau gives a special address",

          "bodyText": "Despite the stronger euro as the dollar weakens, European markets have ended the week on a positive note with the Stoxx index at its highest level for ten years. Growing hopes about company earnings and growth in the economy have combined to offset any negative concerns. In the UK the FTSE 100 has also finished higher, despite a weak performance from retailers after disappointing high street sales figures for December. In the US, early optimism has receded, as investors await news on whether the government faces a shutdown. Worse than expected US consumer confidence figures have also hit sentiment. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 29.83 points or 0.39% at 7730.79 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.15% to 13,434.45 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.58% to 5526.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.5% better at 23,749.22 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.45% at 10,479.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.19% to 847.56 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.21%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend, and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Here\u2019s our latest on Carillion. Rob Davies writes: The chair of the British Medical Association has demanded answers about the future of two major hospitals that Carillion was building when it collapsed, amid mounting concern about the impact of any delays on stretched NHS services. Patients\u2019 groups joined the doctors\u2019 trade body in calling for clarity after local NHS trusts admitted that work on the \u00a3335m Royal Liverpool University and Birmingham\u2019s \u00a3350m Midland Metropolitan hospitals is on hold. Aidan Kehoe, chief executive of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust, said Carillion\u2019s liquidation would further postpone a project that has already been delayed twice. The full story is here: Dr Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit, agrees the impact of a US government shutdown should be modest. But given that could be the case, it might make such a move more likely. He said: The impact of a shutdown, if it happens, on the economy should be very limited as it affects only so-called \u2018non-essential\u2019 government services. Financial markets may also be inclined to discount this renewed display of dysfunctionality in Washington as the tax bill has already been passed. This could be yet another reason why Democrats as well as Republicans may be willing to take a stand and shut the government down That said, they currently still have another 13 hours to prevent such an embarrassment. How bad would a US government shutdown be. Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said: It is still possible that Congress will reach a late deal to avoid a partial government shutdown, but the chances of agreement seem to be slipping away. That said, even if it lasted for a week or more, a shutdown would have only a modest impact on first quarter GDP growth. Oil prices are on track for their biggest weekly fall since October as a recent rally fizzles out. A rise in US production has outweighed declines in inventories, and the output cap agreed by Opec and Russia. Analysts had always expected US shale producers to ramp up their activities as the crude price recovered, providing a counterpoint to the Opec attempts to reduce supplies. The International Energy Agency said in its latest report that global oil stocks had tightened, but it pointed out that the US production increases would have an impact. Brent crude, which hit a three year peak of $70.37 a barrel on Monday, is now down 1% on the day at $68.62. Back with UK retail sales, and while the FTSE 100 might be in positive territory, the representatives from the high street are having a bad day all round. B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher is down 2.6%, the biggest faller in the leading index. It has been hit by, not only the disappointing retail sales figures themselves, but also the profit warning from Carpetright, suggesting big ticket home improvement items are off the agenda at the moment for UK consumers. Carpetright meanwhile is down a massive 43%. Also on the slide are shares in Next, down 1.9%, Tesco, 0.7% lower and - in the FTSE 250 - Dixons Carphone, off 2.6%. The survey indicated some uncertainty about Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, especially the timing of any benefits to consumers, but the bulk of those questioned though the reform would be positive. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said: While the preliminary January reading for the Sentiment Index was largely unchanged from last month (-1.5%), consumers evaluated current economic conditions less favorably (-4.6%). This small decrease in current conditions produced a small overall decline. Importantly, the survey recorded persistent strength in personal finances and buying plans, while favorable levels of buying conditions for household durables have receded to preholiday levels in early January, largely due to less attractive pricing. The Expectations Index remained virtually unchanged at 84.8. Tax reform was spontaneously mentioned by 34% of all respondents; 70% of those who mentioned tax reform thought the impact would be positive, and 18% said it would be negative. The disconnect between the future outlook assessment and the largely positive view of the tax reform is due to uncertainties about the delayed impact of the tax reforms on the consumers. Some of the uncertainty is related to how much a cut or an increase people, especially high income households who live in high-tax states, face Near and long term gas price expectations inched upward in early January but remained significantly below their peak. While long term inflation expectation remained at its 2017 average level and short term inflation expectation inched upward, consumers continued to remain very optimistic about the low national unemployment rate. Meanwhile the latest US economic indicator has come in below expectations. The University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment came in at 94.4 in January, down from December\u2019s final figure of 95.9 and below analysts\u2019 forecasts of a rise to 97. Although of course there are contigency plans being put in place, just in case the US government does shut down...... Here\u2019s our piece earlier on the attempts to prevent a US government shutdown: As expected, US markets have made a positive start, with investors seemingly untroubled by the prospect of a government shutdown. As well as the feeling that a resolution will be found at a vote in the Senate later, the political risks are overshadowed for the moment by optimism over company results during the earnings season. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 12 points or 0.07% higher while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.24% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.32%. There are a couple of potential market moving events ahead in fact: Craig Erlam, analyst at the currency firm Oanda, says US investors are likely to shrug off fears over a US government shutdown when the opening bell rings on Wall Street: US equity markets are seen reversing Thursday\u2019s losses at the open on Friday, even as investors prepare for the first government shutdown since 2013 if the Senate doesn\u2019t pass a temporary spending bill. Investors don\u2019t appear particularly bothered about the prospect of a government shutdown, with the assumption being that one will eventually be signed and any economic impact will be minor or non-existent. While the US dollar has remained under significant pressure, there is little to suggest this is related to the budget talks while rising US yields is likely more a reflection of the general central bank tightening environment. The backdrop for UK consumers will remain tough in 2018 before easing in 2019, according to Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. Commenting on the weak retail sales data out this morning, the former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee says: Taking 2018 as a whole, prices are still likely to increase more than wages, so this will be another year of consumer squeeze. As a result, we expect economic growth to be around 1.5%, not disastrous, but disappointing compared with the mid 2010s. Weak consumer spending will continue to be a drag on the UK economy in 2018, but the prospects are brighter for 2019 and beyond - as long as we get a reasonable Brexit deal with the other EU-27 countries. Greece has won rare praise today from EU commission\u2019s chief spokesperson, Margaritis Schinas, fuelling hopes that debt relief talks could soon be in the offing. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Four days after MPs endorsed more biting austerity measures and reforms in a rowdy parliamentary vote, Greece\u2019s fiscal progress was roundly applauded by the man more usually associated with tough words for the country. In an interview with state-run ERT TV, EU commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas described the bailout compliance review Athens is currently conducting with creditors as a \u201cmodel review\u201d that was \u201cgoing very well.\u201d \u201cEveryone wants Greece to stand firmly on its feet,\u201d he said, insisting it was imperative that forces inside the country supported the corrective economic adjustment reforms that had been legislated under international economic supervision under the three emergency rescue programmes Athens had received. Now that the latest bailout review was about to be concluded \u2013 with eurozone finance ministers expected to unlock up to \u20ac6bn in aid for the country when they meet in Brussels on Monday - discussion on Greece\u2019s post-bailout era could begin, he said. \u201cFrom September, the political winds in Europe have changed,\u201d Schinas said. \u201cFor the first time all of our economies are in growth \u2026 and the euro is regaining its place as an anchor of stability on the world scene.\u201d Back in 2015, Yanis Varoufakis said he Alexis Tsipras whether he was \u201ccompletely stupid\u201d* after the Greek prime minister agreed to a demand by international creditors in for large primary surpluses. Speaking to Parapolitika radio about his time as Greek finance minister, Varoufakis said: I told him: \u2018Are you completely stupid? What did you get in return?\u2019 And he said: \u2018Oh, did I do something stupid? It\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll take it back\u2019. Varoufakis criticised his successor Euclid Tsakalotos, calling him a \u201cyes man\u201d who \u201cI no longer recognise\u201d. Ouch. *Varoufakis said he did not actually use the word \u201cstupid,\u201d it was worse than that. Here\u2019s quick markets round-up from Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets: Equities are positive to close out the week, rebounding from a negative US close and ahead of a key Senate vote to stave off a government shutdown tonight. Weaker than expected UK retail sales have seen the UK\u2019s blue chip index take a leg higher, benefiting from sterling\u2019s retreat from fresh post-referendum highs earlier this morning. Interestingly, Germany\u2019s DAX is the rank outperformer, this in spite of additional euro strength after hawkish ECB comments, whilst US equities point towards a positive open this afternoon. The FTSE has climbed higher thanks to the pound\u2019s weakness...while miners are embracing the weaker dollar\u2019s fillip for metals. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.28% at 7722 while Germany\u2019s Dax is up just over 1% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.47%. Over in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 88 points higher. As for the pound, it is down 0.12% against the dollar at $1.3875 - despite the pressures on the US currency - and 0.27% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1317. It\u2019s that time of year again when world leaders and big thinkers prepare to head to the Swiss ski resort Davos to debate the most pressing social and economic issues. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is the latest world leader to confirm her attendance at the event next week, joining Donald Trump, Theresa May, Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron among others. The work and pensions select committee has written to the pensions regulator with a series of questions on Carillion. Publishing the letter, Frank Field, Labour MP and chair of the committee, said: I am pleased that the liaison committee will be investigating Carillion - the company\u2019s collapse begs questions across government. We have some specific concerns on the pensions side. It beggars belief that a company can be allowed to run with such apparent recklessness - and be so lucrative for the directors and shareholders - when it has a giant pension deficit and a mountain of debt. I will be proposing we take evidence from the company directors, the trustees, the pensions regulator and the auditors who somehow concluded Carillion was a going concern. Where our concerns overlap we will look to work closely with the business committee, as we have done successfully in the past. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of other major currencies, has hit a new three-year low today of 90.331 as fears of a US government shutdown mount. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch believe the dollar will recover some ground against the euro in the coming months. Support for EUR/USD from forward rate divergence may be peaking whilst markets look ahead to the European Central Bank meeting and any commentary on the euro from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi. EUR/USD could be vulnerable from a dovish Draghi. The USD has sharply weakened as a result of the recent wave of global central bank repricing, despite strong US data. EUR/USD appreciation has been supported by relative interest rate expectations, however upside potential looks limited for now. A USD rebound is likely in the first half of 2018, predicated on corporate repatriation flows and vastly underpriced Fed vs ECB expectations. More here on this morning\u2019s dismal UK retail sales data: The STOXX 600, comprising some of the biggest companies across Europe, is at the highest level since August 2015: Investors are in buoyant mood this morning, with gains in all major markets despite the strength of the euro and the pound against the dollar. The FTSE is up 15 points. Latest scores: FTSE 100: +0.2% at 7,716 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.9% at 13,399 France\u2019s CAC: +0.4% at 5,518 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 23,824 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.4% at 10,475 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.4% at 400 Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics says the drop in December retail sales signals \u201ca disappointing end to 2017\u201d. We\u2019ll get the first official estimate of UK economic growth in the final quarter of 2017 from the ONS next week, on 26 January. As it stands, economists polled by Reuters are predicting growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, the same rate as the third quarter. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says retail sales did little to boost the economy in the final quarter of 2017. We\u2019ve been waiting for the pay squeeze to filter through to the high street, but so far retail sales have held up better than many expected. Today\u2019s retail sales data from the ONS disappointed, however, with consumers cutting back on Christmas spending after November\u2019s Black Friday splurge. This continues the trend of bringing Christmas spending forward to take advantage of early discounts. The figures undershot expectations by some margin, falling 1.5% on the month and rising just 1.4% year-on-year. Economists had forecast the latter number at 3.0%. This means retail sales made next to no contribution to UK economic growth in the final three months of 2017. The big question now is whether this is the start of a worrying trend for the economy, or whether falling inflation and rising wages will come to the rescue. The figures from the ONS show that retail sales on 2017 overall rose by 1.9% - the weakest annual growth rate since 2013. The drop in UK retail sales in December has so far failed to hit the pound, which is still up 0.2% at $1.3918. Sterling is down 0.1% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1332, not far off where it was before the retail figures were published. The sharp fall in retail sales over the month of December (-1.5%) can partly be explained be Black Friday sales, which encouraged shoppers to bring forward some of their Christmas spending to November. But people are also finding they have less money to spend because prices are rising faster than wages. Rhian Murphy, a senior statistician at the ONS, explains: Retail sales continued to grow in the last three months of the year partly due to Black Friday deals boosting spending. Consumers continue to move Christmas purchases earlier with higher spending in November and lower spending in December than seen in previous years. However, the longer-term picture is one of slowing growth, with increased prices squeezing people\u2019s spending. Over the year the proportion of internet spending is continuing to rise, with almost one in every five pounds spent online by the end of 2017. Ouch. UK retail sales fell by 1.5% in December, more sharply than the 0.6% drop forecast by economists. It was also a lot worse than November, when sales rose 1%. More soon. The market value of Dignity, one of Britain\u2019s biggest funeral providers, has halved this morning after the company warned that it would have to cut its prices this year as a result of intense competition. Shares are down 50% at 959p, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. Dignity said that while its profits for 2017 were in line with expectations, 2018 would be a different story because it planned to cut the price of some of its funeral services. While the pre-arranged and crematoria businesses are performing strongly with no change to the board\u2019s expectations for these businesses, the board is keen to address the continuing acceleration of price competition facing its funeral business. The board is therefore taking decisive action on its funeral pricing strategy with a view to protecting market share and repositioning the group for future growth. Consequently, the board believes that the results for the period ending 28 December 2018 will be substantially below the market\u2019s current expectations. Effective immediately, the group\u2019s simple funeral will be reduced by an average of approximately 25% and there will also be a price freeze for the group\u2019s traditional funerals in the majority of the group\u2019s locations. Consequently, the group is now embarking on a rigorous review to ensure that its funeral operations are organised to run more efficiently and effectively. The business secretary Greg Clark was put on the defensive when interviewed about Carillion by Nick Robinson on Today. Main points from Clark: Minsters did not meet Carillion bosses at any time after the profit warnings (which began last summer) but were kept informed by \u201cofficials\u201d. Powers are available to the Insolvency Service to claw back bonuses from Carillion\u2019s bosses. He couldn\u2019t say whether the thousands of small businesses owed money by Carillion would be paid. That is a matter for the Insolvency Service. The government was right to keep awarding contracts to Carillion. It will be held to account on these decisions in the coming months. Clark is asked by Nick Robinson why was there no contact between Carillion and senior ministers at any time after the profit warnings, which began in July 2017. Actually there was substantial contact between the crown commercial service who are responsible for the oversight of public sector contracts. That is the appropriate mechanism, you have senior officials monitoring these contracts. Officials report to ministers. So ministers did know that Carillion was in trouble? So why carry on handing them contracts? I think that everyone in the whole country could see the profit warnings that were issued. Many companies give profit warnings, that means they expect to make less money than they had previously forecast. If the government on each occasion downed tools and said we could no longer do business, that would cause difficulties for many companies that were healthy and viable. Over the months ahead there will be lots of opportunities to scrutinise the decisions that were taken. That is right and proper. On the issue of clawing back bonuses from Carillion\u2019s top executives, Greg Clark says the powers exist and will be used where necessary. The Insolvency Service have very powerful sanctions available here. I wrote to the head of the service to make sure the receiver looked not just at the conduct of the current directors, but the previous ones to see if they had contributed to this collapse. And the sanctions including the recovery of bonuses that may have been paid are very substantial and they are available to the Insolvency Service. Greg Clark has been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme talking about Carillion and the taskforce meeting he held on Thursday. He says he is working closely with business organisations, trade unions, banks and the department of work and pensions to make sure everything is done to \u201cmaximise the continuity of these small businesses\u201d that were suppliers to the collapsed Carillion. However, he says the issue of whether these small suppliers will get the money they are owed is a matter for the receivers and not the government. The job of the official receiver is to wind the company up in an orderly way, to realise the assets, and to deal with creditors claims ... so make an assessment of how much people will get back. Our latest story on Carillion: Shares in Carpetright have plunged in early trading after a major profits warning. They are down 48% at 85p. The flooring company said post Christmas trading had been \u201csignificantly behind expectations\u201d and warned full-year profits would come in somewhere between \u00a32m to \u00a36m. The City had been expecting up to \u00a315.6m. Another sign that consumers are growing increasingly reluctant to commit to major, non essential, spending decisions at a time when inflation is outpacing wage growth. Chief executive Wilf Walsh: Despite a positive start to our third quarter, we have seen a significant deterioration in UK trading during the important post-Christmas trading period. While average transaction values were up year on year, the number of customer transactions since Christmas was sharply down, which we believe is indicative of reduced consumer confidence. The severity of the decline in footfall over this key trading period and our more cautious view of the outlook for the balance of the year leads to a significant reduction in our full year expectations. Against this background of a further deterioration in market conditions, we remain committed to driving through the improvements that are essential to the long term repositioning of the business. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound is holding on to its post Brexit-vote highs against the dollar, up 0.2% this morning at $1.3917. It is on course for a fifth weekly rise against the US currency. Sterling has been supported by a number of factors, including optimism over Brexit negotiations, some decent data, and dollar weakness. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets gives his view: It\u2019s been another decent week for the pound as it looks set to post its fifth successive weekly rise in a row against the US dollar. A new post Brexit vote high of $1.3943 this week has raised expectations of a move through the $1.40 area in the next few days in the hope that a more convivial tone will develop between Brussels and London as the prospect of the upcoming trade talks looms on the horizon. While that remains highly optimistic, sterling short positions have continued to get squeezed hard. The pound is down 0.1% against the euro however, at \u20ac1.1340. UK retail sales data for December, published at 9.30am, will provide insight into whether cash-strapped consumers - under pressure from falling real pay - were willing to spend over the Christmas period. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting a 0.6% fall in sales over the month, following a 1.1% increase in November. However, some analysts suspect the number might come in a touch higher after better-than expected figures from the British Retail Consortium. Also this morning we\u2019ve had profit warnings from Carpetright and the funeral provider Dignity. More on those soon.",

          "body": "<p>This year was a remarkable one in terms of women\u2019s rights. From the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2017/jan/21/womens-march-on-washington-and-other-anti-trump-protests-around-the-world-live-coverage\">euphoria of the Women\u2019s March</a> to the pent-up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/women-worldwide-use-hashtag-metoo-against-sexual-harassment\">trauma released by the #MeToo disclosures</a>, 2017 has been a rollercoaster for activists \u2013 and for most women. On Donald Trump\u2019s first full day as US president on 20 January, women\u2019s rights activists marched in unprecedented numbers in more than 70 countries. In October, allegations of a long record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/09/harvey-weinstein-sacked-in-wake-of-sexual-harassment-scandal\">sexual harassment and violence on the part of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein</a> set off a flood of similar allegations against other prominent men across the globe, toppling dozens by the end of the year. Women worldwide are fed up and that frustration was on display in ways that felt unusually visible and global.</p> <p>But if the legacy of 2017 is to be more than a warm glow and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/15/casting-off-trump-the-women-who-cant-stop-knitting-pussy-hats\">pussy hat</a>, 2018 needs to deliver concrete, sustained change. Activists must harness the energy of the marches and #MeToo, connecting the struggles of women and girls internationally and creating change despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/07/womens-rights-are-on-the-retreat-yet-again-why\">women\u2019s rights often feeling increasingly under siege</a>.</p> <p>This year also brought plenty of bad news for women. The <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-gender-gap-report-2017\">World Economic Forum declared that the \u201cglobal gender gap\u201d</a>\u2013 the gap between the status of women and men on four key indicators: health, education, politics and the workplace \u2013 worsened, with growing inequality in economic participation a particular problem. This is the first time the gap has widened since tracking began in 2006. In 2016, the forum predicted that it would take 83 years to close the gender gap; now it estimates 100 years. It said: \u201cEven though qualified women are coming out of the education system, many industries are failing to hire, retain and promote them.\u201d</p> <p>In education, new data from Unicef showed that in countries affected by conflict, girls are 2.5 times more likely to be out of school as boys. In South Sudan, 76% of girls are not studying; in Afghanistan and Chad, the rates are 55% and 53%.</p> <p>Writing this in Yangon, Myanmar, where I\u2019m investigating trafficking of women, I\u2019m painfully aware of how conflict targets women and girls. Human Rights Watch has documented in excruciating detail how the Burmese military has been using rape as part of a campaign of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/23/us-calls-myanmar-treatment-of-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing\">ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya</a>, attacks that were widespread and aimed at terrorising people so severely that they would never return home. Sexual violence against women and girls featured in numerous other conflicts, including in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/18/the-future-is-very-dark-central-african-republics-relentless-cycle-of-suffering\">Central African Republic</a> and Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p>In health, reproductive choice is under attack. Access to family planning services is also directly linked to education, politics and the workplace, since women with control over their fertility are more likely to attend school, to work and to participate in public life. Particularly harmful was the US government\u2019s renewed and expanded imposition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/23/trump-abortion-gag-rule-international-ngo-funding\">\u201cglobal gag rule\u201d</a>, which bans recipients of billions of US aid dollars from even discussing abortion with patients or legislators. This rule is already having devastating consequences as service providers who choose not to comply are forced to shut services as they lose funding. This policy will affect virtually every country that receives US development assistance. A number of other Some donor countries have worked to mitigate the harm of this policy, but the large scale of US aid funding means a huge hole remains.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f294d19fc5b0a0d930ba2b6583f66dcc73d25e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f294d19fc5b0a0d930ba2b6583f66dcc73d25e2a/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester during a march and rally to support women\u2019s health programmes and protest against the White House global gag rule in March 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester during a march and rally to support women\u2019s health programmes and protest against the White House global gag rule in March 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To nurture the seeds of change sown in 2017, the women\u2019s movement will need to find effective ways to embrace the problems of all women. Many have made the point that most of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/16/me-too-victims-perpetrators-sexual-assault\">attention generated by #MeToo</a> has focused on elite workplaces and elite victims \u2013 the sense that many women who have come forward may risk losing a film role but won\u2019t be left unable to feed their children. This response needs to be global, addressing the racial and economic divides that can deprive the movement of unity. Drawing connections and mutual support between a Rohingya rape survivor in Bangladesh and a groped intern in the UK parliament, an out-of-school girl in Tanzania and a woman denied access to abortion in Nicaragua will never be easy. Nevertheless, so many of our problems are faced in common.</p> <p>Child marriage is a glaring example of an abuse that harms girls around the globe. About 15 million girls married as children this year \u2013 one every two seconds \u2013 in many countries, including Britain and the US as well as Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Brazil. Married girls often leave school early, are more likely to live in poverty, are at greater risk of domestic violence and face more serious reproductive health risks, including death in childbirth, than women who marry as adults. Bangladesh, which has one of the highest rates of child marriage, regressed this year and made it again legal for children to marry. <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5891e025e4b080b3dad6fdc4?timestamp=1485955384777\">The UK government opposed legislation that would have ended child marriage</a>. In the US this year, Texas and New York narrowed the circumstances under which children can marry, but <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/despite-progress-child-marriage-is-still-legal-in-all-50-states/\">child marriage is legal in all 50 US states</a>; in 25 states, children of any age can marry under some circumstances.</p> <p>In 2018, our movement will have to widen its scope. Sexual harassment, abuse and assault of women is commonplace in many industries and workplaces. #MeToo has triggered discussion about gender-based employment discrimination, both overt discrimination and the more insidious ways inequality excludes, marginalises and exploits women workers.

Sweden has a \u201cfeminist foreign policy\u201d and this year Canada pledged a feminist policy on overseas aid. They can be held to these policies, which could be models for all democracies.

Yet Die Hard 2 is just the second movie in the Die Hard series, while Die Hard has become \u201ca Christmas movie\u201d. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you watch it at Christmas, or that it\u2019s on prominently in the Christmas TV schedules.</p> <p>But Die Hard most certainly is indelibly associated with Christmas. It crops up in polls of people\u2019s favourite Christmas films: earlier this year, the readers of Empire magazine rated it <a href=\"https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/the-argument-is-over-and-die-hard-best-christmas-movie-ever-2017-12\">the greatest Christmas movie ever</a>.

If that\u2019s not enough the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appeared on breakfast TV in Toronto last Friday, where he asserted: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BTtoronto/status/941676492173348865\">Yes, Die Hard is absolutely a Christmas movie.

And it is one because so many people passionately believe it is. What\u2019s more interesting, though, is why it has become regarded as a Christmas movie, because it certainly wasn\u2019t made as one.</p> <p>Die Hard was released in the US in July 1988, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE1DD133FF936A25754C0A96E948260\">reviewers made only passing reference to its Christmas element</a>\u2013 why would they, given they were writing in the heat of midsummer?

Festive \u2026 watch the trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>So there\u2019s nothing in Die Hard\u2019s history to make it into a Christmas movie. Yet a Christmas movie it has become, but not to everyone. Earlier this month, YouGov released <a href=\"https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ehrpg8lef7/YouGov%20Die%20Hard.pdf\">a poll about the movie</a> \u2013 surely the founders of psephology did not foresee the day that pollsters would be earning a crust assessing the seasonal status of old action films \u2013 which found that only 30% of people thought it was a Christmas film, while 52% didn\u2019t. </p> <p>The age breakdown, though, was more telling . The only age group in which more people thought of Die Hard as a Christmas movie than didn\u2019t was 25- to 34-year-olds (44% against 37%), while 35- to 44-year-olds were narrowly against the idea (42% said it was a Christmas film, 47% said it wasn\u2019t). So Die Hard is most likely to be seen as a Christmas film by those who were too young to see it at the cinema (where it received an 18 certificate). </p> <p>Interestingly, 18- to 24-year-olds, the first generation for whom the box in the corner is not the main provider of visual entertainment, were overwhelmingly against the idea of it being a Christmas film (52% to 28%).</p> <p>If you add in some data, you can see when the association of Die Hard with Christmas begins \u2013 or at least make an educated guess. Google Trends goes back to 2004, but when you look at its <a href=\"https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=die%20hard\">search trends for Die Hard</a>, you can see the first noticeable spike is in December 2006, with small spikes every December since (the two massive spikes are tied in to the release of sequels, and nothing to do with the original film). </p> <p>Something else was happening around the time of that first spike, too: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a> launched in 2004, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter\">Twitter</a> launched in 2006. Suddenly, social media gave people a chance to share their own perspectives, and while some people communicated about politics or society, others really wanted to tell their friends that Die Hard was a Christmas movie. </p> <p>This ties into an observation the film historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewsweet\">Matthew Sweet</a> makes about how the context of films changes when people share a single observation, or a single image. \u201cFilms now have this other afterlife in tiny clips and gifs,\u201d he says, \u201cso a particular image from a film \u2013 like the dead terrorist in the Santa hat in Die Hard \u2013 can break free from the film and have this other life online that might be its most vigorous form of life.\u201d</p> <p>Die Hard is really only a Christmas film to a narrow band of people, and YouGov knows exactly which ones: the ones between young adulthood and early middle age for whom Die Hard has been a constant presence. They think of it the same way as I think of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065207/\">Where Eagles Dare</a>: I know I have seen Where Eagles Dare at Christmas \u2013 I have a vivid memory of Isla St Clair from the Generation Game making it her Christmas pick in the Radio Times \u2013 but I\u2019ve also seen it lots of other times. Yet it\u2019s associated with school holidays in my mind, and so it became a Christmas film. </p> <p>That\u2019s a point Sweet makes, too, suggesting that films associated with some special childhood event get associated with Christmas, because Christmas is the most special time: \u201cYou might find some Christmas films were really Easter films, you just saw them when you were off school,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9de5b39395648378f4d0d9ae96a2c4efd78505a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9de5b39395648378f4d0d9ae96a2c4efd78505a/0_0_620_396/500.jpg\" alt=\"Not down the chimney \u2026 Bruce Willis comes through the window.\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not down the chimney \u2026 Bruce Willis comes through the window.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I suspect that what has really made Die Hard into a Christmas film is its familiarity. Christmas is about routine, about doing things the same way every year, about being able to slip into familiar roles with barely a thought. A film as boundlessly familiar as Die Hard slips into that same part of the mind. It makes no demands: once seen, it is a film one can begin watching at any point without the slightest trouble. It almost doesn\u2019t matter whether or not Die Hard is actually on at Christmas: the very certainty of it makes it seem as if it should be, and that is backed by the example of another non-Christmas film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wizard-of-oz\">the Wizard of Oz</a>. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It makes no demands: once seen, it is a film one can begin watching at any point without the slightest trouble</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On both sides of the Atlantic, there are many who regard the Wizard of Oz as a Christmas film, because they think they saw it on TV at Christmas.

Not selling arms to a regime that is the most repressive and probably one of the worst human rights violators, particularly towards women, like Saudi Arabia?\u201d Singh asked, alluding to the government\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/31/saudi-arabia-violence-canada-armored-trucks-justin-trudeau\">push forward with a billion-dollar arms deal with the country.</a> </p> <p>More than two years after Trudeau swept into power, little has been done to address a gender pay gap that ranks among the highest in the OECD. \u201cInstead of just talking about the fact that women should be equal, let\u2019s put legislation that enforces pay equity. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/justin-trudeau-feminism-scorecard\">We don\u2019t have that.</a>\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3ff2d45dfdc0bb5259b386c747ec38d7b1d48af0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ff2d45dfdc0bb5259b386c747ec38d7b1d48af0/0_419_5600_3359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singh meets with a young activist in Ontario.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singh meets with a young activist in Ontario.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Trump presidency is another, trickier example, said Singh. While other western leaders <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-jerusalem-israel-1.4436251\">have at times criticised the president\u2019s actions,</a> Trudeau has remained tight-lipped, saying earlier this year that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/13/justin-trudeau-donald-trump-meeting-canada-trade-immigration\">it was not his place to \u201clecture another country\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Singh said he would do things differently. \u201cI think there\u2019s a certain principle you can\u2019t compromise. If someone is being misogynistic, you have to name it. It\u2019s not convenient to talk about discrimination, but if you don\u2019t do it, you allow it to exist. So you have to name it,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Born in Canada to parents from Punjab, Singh has been vocal about his experience of growing up as a minority in Canada. In doing so, he\u2019s dragged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/12/canada-black-lives-matter-indigenous-people-muslims\">some of the darker aspects of</a> Canada\u2019s vaunted promotion of multiculturalism into the spotlight \u2013 from the relentless bullying he suffered as a child to the 11 times that he\u2019s been stopped by police because of his appearance. </p> <p>Singh says such experiences also explain his fondness for well-cut suits \u2013 a hallmark of wealth not usually associated with leftist politicians. \u201cAs a kid, I got a lot of attention \u2013 and it was bad attention,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I thought: you know what, let me give them something to stare at. Let me just own this.\u201d </p> <p> </p> <p>He\u2019s quick to contrast his background with that of Trudeau, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/17/trudeau-son-canada\">son of a former prime minister and who worked as a drama teacher</a> and snowboarding instructor before making the leap into politics. \u201cI get what it\u2019s like to be mistreated or face unfairness just because of who you are,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Singh was in his 20s when his father became ill, catapulting him into the role of sole income earner in his family. He became the primary caregiver for his younger brother \u2013 making meals, buying him clothes and even attending parent-teacher interviews \u2013 until his father was able to work again.</p> <p>Singh\u2019s efforts have done little to curb <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/jagmeet-singh-is-trudeaus-worst-nightmare/article36464035/\">comparisons between him and Trudeau.</a> After all, both are confident, charismatic and savvy social media users who draw swarms of selfie-seekers wherever they go. At times the parallels are hard to ignore; Trudeau is a boxer while Singh has competed across North America in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/931901672682438657\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Man\u2019s not hot <a href=\"https://t.co/XzEk3RY0g4\">pic.twitter.com/XzEk3RY0g4</a></p>&mdash; Jagmeet Singh (@theJagmeetSingh) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJagmeetSingh/status/931901672682438657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And both face critics who describe them as more style than substance. Singh smiled at the assessment, before rattling off a list of accomplishments. Fluent in English, Punjabi and French, he earned a degree in biology before turning to law. He practised as a criminal defence lawyer for six years, balancing his career with pro bono work for anti-poverty activists and groups dedicated to immigration and refugee rights. </p> <p>In 2011, he was elected to the Ontario legislature. While there, he fought to improve the working conditions of temporary workers and ban racially motivated police checks, rising through the ranks to become the deputy leader of the Ontario NDP. </p> <p>\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know, does that sound like a lack of substance?\u201d Singh asked.</p> <p>While less than 2% of Canadians identify as Sikh, Canada\u2019s parliament is home to 20 Sikhs, including four who are part of Trudeau\u2019s Liberal cabinet \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/news-video/video-punjabi-now-third-most-spoken-language-in-house-of-commons/article27071850/\">making Punjabi the third-most-spoken language</a> in the House of Commons. Even so, Singh\u2019s quest to become the first non-white leader of a national party has laid bare the many challenges that remain. </p> <p>Some NDP <a href=\"http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1056349/signes-religieux-jagmeet-singh-npd-incompatibles-quebecois-selon-depute-pierre-nantel\">party members in Quebec</a> \u2013 where the party holds most of its seats \u2013 argued that the province\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/quebec-passes-law-banning-muslims-from-wearing-face-coverings-in-public\">deep belief in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/quebec-passes-law-banning-muslims-from-wearing-face-coverings-in-public\">secularism</a> would clash with a leader who wears a turban and kirpan. </p> <p>On his first day as NDP leader, a CBC interview questioned him on the legacy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/canada-air-india-bombing-inderjit-singh-reyat-freed\">the 1985 Air India bombing</a>, believed by police to be carried out by Sikh militants living in Canada. Singh pointed out that he was about five years old when the bombing took place, but the CBC later <a href=\"http://www.ombudsman.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/complaint-reviews/2017/power-politics-the-interview-of-jagmeet-singh/\">said the question was fair,</a> alluding to Singh\u2019s involvement with the <a href=\"http://sikhactivist.net/\">Sikh Activist Network</a> (a youth group co-founded by his brother) and his push to have the 1984 riots in New Delhi against Sikhs recognised in Ontario <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jagmeetndp/posts/436809123033340\">as an act of genocide.</a></p> <p></p> <p>Media commentators have asked <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wherry-jagmeet-singh-1.4119920\">if Canada is ready for a non-white NDP leader, </a>pointing to a recent poll in <a href=\"http://angusreid.org/new-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh/\">which 31% of the 1,477 respondents said they would not vote for a politician who wore a turban and carried a kirpan.</a> </p> <p>Singh contrasted these points with an incident from the leadership campaign, when <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/jagmeet-singh-responds-to-heckler-1.4282702\">an angry heckler crashed a meet and greet session</a> and repeatedly accused Singh of wanting to impose Sharia law in Canada. \u201cWe believe in love and courage,\u201d Singh told her, deftly defusing the situation. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be intimidated by hate.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8be1ee53bd26ebc28a8c6674928cfed9cfdbfd63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8be1ee53bd26ebc28a8c6674928cfed9cfdbfd63/187_410_2957_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singh takes a selfie with a passerby\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singh takes a selfie with a passerby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He later explained in a statement: \u201cI didn\u2019t answer the question because my response to Islamophobia has never been: \u2018I\u2019m not Muslim.\u2019 It has always been \u2013 and will be \u2013 that hate is wrong. Once allowed to grow, hate doesn\u2019t pick and choose.\u201d</p> <p>Months later, Singh still describes it as a defining moment, pointing to the millions of views the video racked up on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome that there\u2019s so many people that are still thirsty for that type of politics or that type of leadership,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The incident, however, also hinted at the work that lies ahead. \u201cThe reality is that I\u2019m in an uphill battle,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I have to work extra hard to prove myself \u2013 and I\u2019ve always had to do that, so I\u2019m up for the challenge.\u201d </p>",

He takes the reins of a party with a political platform that includes decriminalising all drugs, expanding universal health care, raising taxes on high earners and tackling precarious work. But even as progressive movements bloom around the world, the NDP is struggling.

More than two years after Trudeau swept into power, little has been done to address a gender pay gap that ranks among the highest in the OECD. \u201cInstead of just talking about the fact that women should be equal, let\u2019s put legislation that enforces pay equity. We don\u2019t have that.\u201d The Trump presidency is another, trickier example, said Singh. While other western leaders have at times criticised the president\u2019s actions, Trudeau has remained tight-lipped, saying earlier this year that it was not his place to \u201clecture another country\u201d. Singh said he would do things differently. \u201cI think there\u2019s a certain principle you can\u2019t compromise. If someone is being misogynistic, you have to name it. It\u2019s not convenient to talk about discrimination, but if you don\u2019t do it, you allow it to exist. So you have to name it,\u201d he said. Born in Canada to parents from Punjab, Singh has been vocal about his experience of growing up as a minority in Canada. In doing so, he\u2019s dragged some of the darker aspects of Canada\u2019s vaunted promotion of multiculturalism into the spotlight \u2013 from the relentless bullying he suffered as a child to the 11 times that he\u2019s been stopped by police because of his appearance. Singh says such experiences also explain his fondness for well-cut suits \u2013 a hallmark of wealth not usually associated with leftist politicians. \u201cAs a kid, I got a lot of attention \u2013 and it was bad attention,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I thought: you know what, let me give them something to stare at. Let me just own this.\u201d He\u2019s quick to contrast his background with that of Trudeau, the son of a former prime minister and who worked as a drama teacher and snowboarding instructor before making the leap into politics. \u201cI get what it\u2019s like to be mistreated or face unfairness just because of who you are,\u201d he said. Singh was in his 20s when his father became ill, catapulting him into the role of sole income earner in his family. He became the primary caregiver for his younger brother \u2013 making meals, buying him clothes and even attending parent-teacher interviews \u2013 until his father was able to work again. Singh\u2019s efforts have done little to curb comparisons between him and Trudeau. After all, both are confident, charismatic and savvy social media users who draw swarms of selfie-seekers wherever they go. At times the parallels are hard to ignore; Trudeau is a boxer while Singh has competed across North America in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. And both face critics who describe them as more style than substance. Singh smiled at the assessment, before rattling off a list of accomplishments. Fluent in English, Punjabi and French, he earned a degree in biology before turning to law. He practised as a criminal defence lawyer for six years, balancing his career with pro bono work for anti-poverty activists and groups dedicated to immigration and refugee rights. In 2011, he was elected to the Ontario legislature. While there, he fought to improve the working conditions of temporary workers and ban racially motivated police checks, rising through the ranks to become the deputy leader of the Ontario NDP. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know, does that sound like a lack of substance?\u201d Singh asked. While less than 2% of Canadians identify as Sikh, Canada\u2019s parliament is home to 20 Sikhs, including four who are part of Trudeau\u2019s Liberal cabinet \u2013 making Punjabi the third-most-spoken language in the House of Commons. Even so, Singh\u2019s quest to become the first non-white leader of a national party has laid bare the many challenges that remain. Some NDP party members in Quebec \u2013 where the party holds most of its seats \u2013 argued that the province\u2019s deep belief in secularism would clash with a leader who wears a turban and kirpan. On his first day as NDP leader, a CBC interview questioned him on the legacy of the 1985 Air India bombing, believed by police to be carried out by Sikh militants living in Canada. Singh pointed out that he was about five years old when the bombing took place, but the CBC later said the question was fair, alluding to Singh\u2019s involvement with the Sikh Activist Network (a youth group co-founded by his brother) and his push to have the 1984 riots in New Delhi against Sikhs recognised in Ontario as an act of genocide. Media commentators have asked if Canada is ready for a non-white NDP leader, pointing to a recent poll in which 31% of the 1,477 respondents said they would not vote for a politician who wore a turban and carried a kirpan. Singh contrasted these points with an incident from the leadership campaign, when an angry heckler crashed a meet and greet session and repeatedly accused Singh of wanting to impose Sharia law in Canada. \u201cWe believe in love and courage,\u201d Singh told her, deftly defusing the situation. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be intimidated by hate.\u201d He later explained in a statement: \u201cI didn\u2019t answer the question because my response to Islamophobia has never been: \u2018I\u2019m not Muslim.\u2019 It has always been \u2013 and will be \u2013 that hate is wrong. Once allowed to grow, hate doesn\u2019t pick and choose.\u201d Months later, Singh still describes it as a defining moment, pointing to the millions of views the video racked up on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome that there\u2019s so many people that are still thirsty for that type of politics or that type of leadership,\u201d he said. The incident, however, also hinted at the work that lies ahead. \u201cThe reality is that I\u2019m in an uphill battle,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I have to work extra hard to prove myself \u2013 and I\u2019ve always had to do that, so I\u2019m up for the challenge.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>Australia is a decent country where ugly discrimination is on the rise. We\u2019re no longer listening when our leaders urge us to face down bigots in the interest of calm and good sense. Most of us embrace life in the new multiethnic Australia, but the constituency of those hostile to race is steadily growing.</p> <p>That is the verdict of the Scanlon Foundation\u2019s 2017 Mapping Social Cohesion Report published on Wednesday. The mission of the foundation is to measure how this migrant nation hangs together. The author of its reports is a leading expert on the impact of race in Australia, Andrew Markus of Monash University.</p> <p>\u201cWe think of social cohesion in a country like Australia as money in the bank,\u201d says Markus. \u201cBut we\u2019re running out of reserve funds. The numbers still haven\u2019t shifted very much, but there are some indicators that that reserve, our capacity to deal with shocks that might be down the way, is running out. We\u2019re not resilient.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/27/backstage-with-pauline-hanson-a-cocktail-of-righteous-patriotism-vitriol-and-fear\">Backstage with Pauline Hanson: a cocktail of righteous patriotism, vitriol and fear</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since his work began in 2007, Markus has polled more than 40,000 people to find what we think of our country and its future. About this time each year, he moves quietly around Australia, briefing politicians, bureaucrats and commentators before each new report appears. This is his 10th.</p> <p>He cautions against both wild optimism and despair. Wild swings of opinion are not the danger he identifies here. What he sees are figures shifting a little each year into hostile territory. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the numbers move.\u201d</p> <p>Some barely budge. Set in stone, year after year, is our pride and optimism; our happiness and sense of belonging in this place; our trust in public institutions; and our enthusiasm for immigration \u2013 blind to race and religion \u2013 on a big scale.</p> <p>The 2017 report confirms:</p> <ul> <li> 80% of Australians reject the notion of selecting immigrants by race,<br></li> <li>85% believe multiculturalism is good for this country. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong brand,\u201d says Markus. \u201cYou even go to rural areas and get amazing majorities of people who think it\u2019s good for Australia.\u201d<br></li> <li>74% reject the idea of selecting immigrants by religion, and</li> <li>56% of us believe the number of migrants Australia takes each year is either about right or too low.</li> </ul> <p>In the world right now, majority support for mass immigration is remarkable. Particularly since the global financial crisis, parties have sprung up everywhere demanding governments shut the door on foreigners. Brexit and Donald Trump rode that fear to victory. \u201cA number of countries are doing very badly,\u201d Marcus observes. \u201cWe continue to do well.\u201d</p> <p>Pauline Hanson has mustered a following out on the right, but the Scanlon surveys over a number of years show her efforts have not \u2013 so far - shifted the fundamentals. Indeed, it\u2019s the <em>steadiness</em> of support for big immigration that Markus cites as the single most interesting finding in his 2017 report.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers on immigration haven\u2019t really moved. This used to be a measure that jumped around. It\u2019s stable. That\u2019s a sea change for Australia.\u201d</p> <p>But yet \u2026</p> <p>Also set in stone is our hostility to Islam. Year in year out, unaffected by rising or falling fears of terrorism, a quarter of Australians quizzed on the phone by Markus\u2019s people admitted to negative attitudes to Muslims.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On Muslims, there\u2019s a lot of disquiet \u2026 there\u2019s a resource for people who want to work that constituency</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alert to the possibility that in such sensitive territory people may give pollsters a polite response, Markus had the same questions put to respondents online. Then the number of Australians perturbed by Islam rose to 41%.</p> <p>Markus rates either figure very high.</p> <p>\u201cOn one level, we\u2019re doing really well as a society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re under pressure and we\u2019re of coping with that. There are all these stories about overcrowding, public transport, housing and everything. That could have gone negative on immigration and so on, but it hasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cBut on an issue such as Muslims, there\u2019s a lot of disquiet \u2026 there\u2019s a resource out there for people who want to work that constituency and it\u2019s a sizeable resource. So as a society the risk level has gone up. We were better off in 2007 than we are in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, Markus turns to another grim finding that pollsters for the Scanlon Foundation confirmed in 2017: the general collapse of faith in government in this country. The numbers are unarguable: it happened under Rudd in 2010. \u201cThe patient was dead at that point,\u201d says Markus. \u201cThere\u2019s been no signs of life since.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/28/were-quick-to-label-refugees-as-either-good-or-bad-but-theyre-all-entitled-to-protection\">We're quick to label refugees as either 'good' or 'bad', but they're all entitled to protection | Amos Roberts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That leaves us without the traditional bulwark against race panic: inspiring political leadership. \u201cWhen Turnbull gets up as prime minister and says \u2018we are the most successful multicultural country in the world\u2019 \u2026 people are not listening to him, period.\u201d</p> <p>Canada is his model. There\u2019s a lot about Canada and its new prime minister in the 2017 report. It\u2019s the country so like us, yet without our race demons.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Justin Trudeau comes in and half his cabinet are of a non-English speaking background and women are properly represented, that\u2019s sending a signal to the country and it\u2019s giving leadership,\u201d Markus says. \u201cHere, the Liberals can\u2019t announce a policy without the rest of the Liberal party attacking it the following day, not to mention the Labor party or the Greens. So that level of instability that we have in our country means that issues such as this [race] can\u2019t be addressed.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s getting ugly out there. Markus is particularly disturbed by the steep rise in reports of discrimination over the past decade: \u201cThere are very few indicators that have shown that level of change where you\u2019re getting double.\u201d</p> <p>The jump came in 2013. Markus isn\u2019t sure why. Perhaps it had something to do with the election of the Abbott government. But suddenly about a third of non-English speakers were reporting experiencing discrimination \u2013 perhaps yelling in the street but at times much worse than mere harassment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pauline Hanson getting up and doing her burqa stunt and so on. All of those things have consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2015 a special Scanlon survey found the situation far worse for Australia\u2019s African community: 80% of them reported being targets of abuse or worse that year. </p> <p>How can this be the country that boasts such support for immigration and near-universal backing for multiculturalism?</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to be contradictory,\u201d says Markus. \u201cIt\u2019s not, because it doesn\u2019t mean everyone across the population is engaging in discrimination. What I think this more means is that that minority which has strongly set its face against diversity, set it face again multiculturalism and so on, they\u2019re emboldened to act out their feelings, that the environment legitimates that. Pauline Hanson getting up and doing her burqa stunt and so on. All of those things have consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Markus has gathered the best numbers we have yet seen on One Nation voters. They are elusive creatures, difficult for pollsters to corner.

          "bodyText": "Australia is a decent country where ugly discrimination is on the rise. We\u2019re no longer listening when our leaders urge us to face down bigots in the interest of calm and good sense. Most of us embrace life in the new multiethnic Australia, but the constituency of those hostile to race is steadily growing. That is the verdict of the Scanlon Foundation\u2019s 2017 Mapping Social Cohesion Report published on Wednesday. The mission of the foundation is to measure how this migrant nation hangs together. The author of its reports is a leading expert on the impact of race in Australia, Andrew Markus of Monash University. \u201cWe think of social cohesion in a country like Australia as money in the bank,\u201d says Markus. \u201cBut we\u2019re running out of reserve funds. The numbers still haven\u2019t shifted very much, but there are some indicators that that reserve, our capacity to deal with shocks that might be down the way, is running out. We\u2019re not resilient.\u201d Since his work began in 2007, Markus has polled more than 40,000 people to find what we think of our country and its future. About this time each year, he moves quietly around Australia, briefing politicians, bureaucrats and commentators before each new report appears. This is his 10th. He cautions against both wild optimism and despair. Wild swings of opinion are not the danger he identifies here. What he sees are figures shifting a little each year into hostile territory. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the numbers move.\u201d Some barely budge. Set in stone, year after year, is our pride and optimism; our happiness and sense of belonging in this place; our trust in public institutions; and our enthusiasm for immigration \u2013 blind to race and religion \u2013 on a big scale. The 2017 report confirms: 80% of Australians reject the notion of selecting immigrants by race, 85% believe multiculturalism is good for this country. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong brand,\u201d says Markus. \u201cYou even go to rural areas and get amazing majorities of people who think it\u2019s good for Australia.\u201d 74% reject the idea of selecting immigrants by religion, and 56% of us believe the number of migrants Australia takes each year is either about right or too low. In the world right now, majority support for mass immigration is remarkable. Particularly since the global financial crisis, parties have sprung up everywhere demanding governments shut the door on foreigners. Brexit and Donald Trump rode that fear to victory. \u201cA number of countries are doing very badly,\u201d Marcus observes. \u201cWe continue to do well.\u201d Pauline Hanson has mustered a following out on the right, but the Scanlon surveys over a number of years show her efforts have not \u2013 so far - shifted the fundamentals. Indeed, it\u2019s the steadiness of support for big immigration that Markus cites as the single most interesting finding in his 2017 report. \u201cThe numbers on immigration haven\u2019t really moved. This used to be a measure that jumped around. It\u2019s stable. That\u2019s a sea change for Australia.\u201d But yet \u2026 Also set in stone is our hostility to Islam. Year in year out, unaffected by rising or falling fears of terrorism, a quarter of Australians quizzed on the phone by Markus\u2019s people admitted to negative attitudes to Muslims. Alert to the possibility that in such sensitive territory people may give pollsters a polite response, Markus had the same questions put to respondents online. Then the number of Australians perturbed by Islam rose to 41%. Markus rates either figure very high. \u201cOn one level, we\u2019re doing really well as a society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re under pressure and we\u2019re of coping with that. There are all these stories about overcrowding, public transport, housing and everything. That could have gone negative on immigration and so on, but it hasn\u2019t. \u201cBut on an issue such as Muslims, there\u2019s a lot of disquiet \u2026 there\u2019s a resource out there for people who want to work that constituency and it\u2019s a sizeable resource. So as a society the risk level has gone up. We were better off in 2007 than we are in 2017.\u201d At this point, Markus turns to another grim finding that pollsters for the Scanlon Foundation confirmed in 2017: the general collapse of faith in government in this country. The numbers are unarguable: it happened under Rudd in 2010. \u201cThe patient was dead at that point,\u201d says Markus. \u201cThere\u2019s been no signs of life since.\u201d That leaves us without the traditional bulwark against race panic: inspiring political leadership. \u201cWhen Turnbull gets up as prime minister and says \u2018we are the most successful multicultural country in the world\u2019 \u2026 people are not listening to him, period.\u201d Canada is his model. There\u2019s a lot about Canada and its new prime minister in the 2017 report. It\u2019s the country so like us, yet without our race demons. \u201cWhen Justin Trudeau comes in and half his cabinet are of a non-English speaking background and women are properly represented, that\u2019s sending a signal to the country and it\u2019s giving leadership,\u201d Markus says. \u201cHere, the Liberals can\u2019t announce a policy without the rest of the Liberal party attacking it the following day, not to mention the Labor party or the Greens. So that level of instability that we have in our country means that issues such as this [race] can\u2019t be addressed.\u201d And it\u2019s getting ugly out there. Markus is particularly disturbed by the steep rise in reports of discrimination over the past decade: \u201cThere are very few indicators that have shown that level of change where you\u2019re getting double.\u201d The jump came in 2013. Markus isn\u2019t sure why. Perhaps it had something to do with the election of the Abbott government. But suddenly about a third of non-English speakers were reporting experiencing discrimination \u2013 perhaps yelling in the street but at times much worse than mere harassment. In 2015 a special Scanlon survey found the situation far worse for Australia\u2019s African community: 80% of them reported being targets of abuse or worse that year. How can this be the country that boasts such support for immigration and near-universal backing for multiculturalism? \u201cIt seems to be contradictory,\u201d says Markus. \u201cIt\u2019s not, because it doesn\u2019t mean everyone across the population is engaging in discrimination. What I think this more means is that that minority which has strongly set its face against diversity, set it face again multiculturalism and so on, they\u2019re emboldened to act out their feelings, that the environment legitimates that. Pauline Hanson getting up and doing her burqa stunt and so on. All of those things have consequences.\u201d Markus has gathered the best numbers we have yet seen on One Nation voters. They are elusive creatures, difficult for pollsters to corner. But the 2017 Scanlon report gives a vivid picture of the passions that drive them. The easy political narrative is that One Nation voters are losers in the modern economy: protest voters on the skids. Marcus\u2019s figures don\u2019t support that. His findings show Hanson\u2019s people are set apart by their gloom, their contempt for government and their deep loyalty to white Australia. The party breakdown Markus gives for those \u201cvery pessimistic \u201cabout Australia\u2019s future is: Greens: 6% Labor: 10% Coalition: 7% One Nation: 35% One Nation voters are patriots of a kind who, far more than any others, strongly agree it\u2019s important to maintain \u201cthe Australian way of life and culture\u201d: Greens: 24% Labor: 57% Coalition: 66% One Nation: 92% They are utterly pissed off with politics and reckon our system of government needs to be replaced or have major changes: Greens: 52% Labor: 36% Coalition: 29% One Nation: 80% They dream of having strong leaders not shackled to parliaments. Markus reveals a surprising level of support across the parties for such an authoritarian world but One Nation voters are way out in front: Greens: 14% Labor: 25% Coalition: 19% One Nation: 37% Hanson\u2019s followers are revealed not to be troubled by climate change or perturbed by drugs, marriage breakdown or other social issues facing the country. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about the gap between rich and poor. They\u2019re rather hostile to help governments give to those in need. Nor are they driven by fears about national security. Almost the only plank in the their platform is hostility to immigration. Immigration they list above the economy as the most pressing issue facing the country.

Will they grow out of such generous feelings? Will time turn them into crabby figures in their 70s whose fears and suspicions colour the life of the country?

However, the future princess has been critical of the US president, branding him \u201cmisogynistic\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The prospect of Trump attending the ceremony is an unlikely one. With the level of protection that surrounds an American president, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event.</p> \n  <p>Trump\u2019s appearance could also spark mass protests.</p> \n  <p>When Theresa May offered Trump an early invite for a state visit, the decision proved controversial with polls suggesting up to two million people would take to the streets to demonstrate should the trip go ahead.</p> \n  <p>In 2011, the then US president, Barack Obama, and the first lady, Michelle Obama, were not invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding, reportedly because of the added security cost. But they were feted with a state visit to the UK a month later.</p> \n  <p>Should Trump travel to the UK for a state visit, it would be expected that the newly royal Markle would meet him and join guests at the state banquet. But Markle, who backed Hillary Clinton for president, suggested in a television interview in 2016 that she would leave the US for Canada if Trump won.</p> \n  <p>She said: \u201cWe film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada. I mean come on, if that\u2019s reality we are talking about, come on, that is a gamechanger in terms of how we move in the world here.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Markle told Larry Wilmore\u2019s Nightly Show in the US: \u201cYes, of course Trump is divisive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThink about just female voters alone. I think it was in 2012, the Republican party lost the female vote by 12 points. That\u2019s a huge number and as misogynistic as Trump is and so vocal about it, that\u2019s a huge chunk of it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>For the 1981 wedding of Harry\u2019s parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, Ronald Reagan did not attend but his wife, Nancy Reagan, did. This could be an option for Harry, who has already met the current first lady, Melania Trump.</p> \n  <p>The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be expected to receive one of the sought-after invites, along with other Commonwealth leaders from across the globe.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T14:35:00.918Z\">at 2.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1c0ed27e54bf066ccdc93f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T13:14:44.512Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wished Harry and Meghan well, after party members booed when reporters asked him about the engagement.</p> \n  <p>After he gave a speech in Glasgow, Corbyn ignored the booing by activists and said: \u201cI wish them well, I hope they have a great time and great fun together, and having met Harry a couple of times I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to have a great deal of fun.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Corbyn added: \u201cI really do admire the way that Harry and his brother have drawn attention to mental health conditions all across the country.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI wish him well, thank him for what he has done on mental health, hope they have a great life together.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39816540322722ad66a43751938ca00ab826c865\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39816540322722ad66a43751938ca00ab826c865/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn in Glasgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn in Glasgow.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Linton/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T13:35:10.050Z\">at 1.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a1c0c299ab3f2056cb1c19e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/robertbooth\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-27T13:00:28.858Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Details of the venue and timing of the wedding are expected to be released on Tuesday with aides only saying it will be \u201ca happy church wedding\u201d.<br><br>Harry is understood to have told his close staff two weeks ago that he wanted to make the engagement public today and planning has been under way since then.

He said he was enjoying the changing of the guard. Asked about Prince Harry\u2019s engagement, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know much about him.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The one Briton the Guardian was able to find was a tour guide who had been showing Essel and others from his party the sights. \u201cPersonally I couldn\u2019t care less, but for my job I have to take an interest,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI hope it will never be on the front page when there are so many other important things happening. I bet Theresa [May] will be pleased; we\u2019ve got a royal wedding as a distraction.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, she said she had nothing against Harry, and it was a good thing that his marrying a mixed race woman would introduce a bit of diversity into the royal family. But, she added: \u201cHe\u2019s the spare anyway, he\u2019s not important.

          "bodyText": "What a day. You can read the full report by the Guardian\u2019s Robert Booth here: It started with an exciting announcement from Kensington Palace. Then the couple posed for photos. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle gave a 20-minute interview, which you can watch here: You can share your joy at the royal engagement, or any other emotion, on the Guardian website. Thanks for following today\u2019s action. Have a peaceful evening. Actor Patrick J Adams, who plays Markle\u2019s on-screen partner in the TV show Suits, has joked he feels cheated by the engagement. Adams also sent his best wishes to the couple, and said Prince Harry is a \u201clucky man\u201d. Still nothing from Donald Trump, but not everybody has managed to get their congratulations message right. DUP leader Arlene Foster has apologised to the couple and the Duke of Cambridge after sending her congratulations to the wrong prince. The message also mis-spelt Ms Markle\u2019s first name. The MP has now corrected the mistake. You can now watch the full interview here: Prince Harry said Meghan and his late mother, Princess Diana, would have been \u201cthick as thieves\u201d. I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends \u2013 best friends with Meghan. You know, it is days like today I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But, you know, with the ring and with everything else that\u2019s going on, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s with us. When asked about the ring, which is decorated with diamonds from Princess Diana\u2019s collection, Markle said: The inclusion of that and, obviously not being able to meet his mom, it\u2019s so important to me to \u2013 to know that she\u2019s a part of this with us. I think in being able to meet his aunts... and different people who were so important to his mom, I\u2019m able to, in some way, know a part of her through them and of course through him. It\u2019s incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this [the ring] which sort of links where you come from and Botswana which is important to us. It\u2019s perfect. Dogs came up a lot in the big interview. Prince Harry said the Queen\u2019s corgis took to Markle straight away. The prince joked: I\u2019ve spent the last 33 years being barked at, this one walks in, absolutely nothing... Markle said: [The corgis were] just laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet. When asked if she would bring her own dogs to the UK, the actor said: Well I have two dogs that I\u2019ve had for quite a long time, both my rescue pups. And one is now staying with very close friends and my other little guy is \u2013 yes he\u2019s in the UK, he\u2019s been here for a while. Markle revealed the prince designed the ring he gave her. Harry said: The ring is yellow gold because that\u2019s her favourite, and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother\u2019s jewellery collection to make sure that she\u2019s with us on this \u2013 on this crazy journey together. Here\u2019s a quick dispatch from my colleague Robert Booth: Meghan Markle has described as \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d some of the media coverage she received as Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend because it centred on her racial background. In an interview to mark their engagement announced on Monday, Harry also said the couple were \u201ctotally unprepared for what happened\u201d in terms of the coverage, which forced him to take the rare step last year of attacking the British press for introducing \u201cracial overtones\u201d into the reporting of his relationship with an American actor. Markle, whose mother is African American and father is white, said the extent of media interest had been \u201ca learning curve and said \u201cI did not have any understanding of what it would be like\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day I am proud of who I am and where I have come from and we have never put any focus on that, we have just focused on who we are as a couple.\u201d The couple, who will marry next spring in what a royal source said would be a \u201chappy church wedding\u201d, revealed how Prince Harry proposed at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace on \u201ca standard typical night in for us\u201d while they were roasting a chicken for dinner. Markle said it was \u201cjust an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee . . . I could barely let you finish proposing. I said \u2018can I say yes now?\u2019\u201d \u201cThen there were hugs and I had the ring in my finger and I was like can I give you the ring? She goes \u2013 oh yes the ring.\u201d Markle said meeting the Queen was \u201cincredible\u201d. \u201cTo be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honour and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother, all of those layers have been so important for me,\u201d she said. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been speaking to the BBC\u2019s Mishal Husain about their relationship. The couple revealed they met on a blind date after being matched by a friend. The prince had \u201cnever even heard of\u201d Markle before the date, but said he was \u201cbeautifully surprised\u201d when he met her. Just under five minutes until the BBC airs its interview with the couple. Nigel Farage, look away now. Meghan Markle appears to be a remainer. On 2 July last year, thousands protested against the Brexit vote in central London. Meghan Markle seems to have been among them. That day, she posted a photo on Instagram showing a sign reading: \u201cIf EU leave me now, you take away the biggest part of me.\u201d Still no word from the US president but Justin Trudeau in Canada has offered his sincere congratulations. Markle has a connection with Canada as Suits is filmed in Toronto and she has lived there as a result. Additionally, Harry and Markle\u2019s first public appearance as a couple was at the Invictus Games in the city. Here is a video the Guardian has made about Meghan Markle: Their marriage will bring into reality what the British establishment lacked the imagination to even conceive of as possible 17 years ago \u2013 that a senior royal can love, and marry, someone whose ethnic heritage is not just different to his own, but the heritage that has always been most othered in Britain \u2013 black and African. The royal family plays a largely symbolic role in our society, so it\u2019s the symbolism of this engagement that interests me. I struggled growing up with the feeling that the monarchy were fundamental to Britishness, but that the Britishness they represented was one that excluded me. This exclusion mattered. It made other people perceive being truly British, and being black, as incompatible identities. It represented a giant taboo. Every government that I can remember made some attempt, rhetorical at least, to acknowledge and protect racial diversity. The family at the apex of our society was doing anything but. This is not the news people wanted to hear (not that it makes much difference to us journalists who will all have to work whatever) but Downing Street has said there are \u201cno plans\u201d for a bank holiday on the day of Prince Harry\u2019s wedding. When William and Kate were married there was a bonus bank holiday but the difference in this case is that William is a likely future king while Harry is not. Markle\u2019s on-screen father in Suits, Wendell Pierce, has tweeted his congratulations. He is perhaps the coolest person to have publicly offered his good wishes to date (no offence to Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Philip Hammond, Fearne Cotton, Ronan Keating etc). Pierce, who plays Robert Zane in Suits and was also Bunk in the Wire, wrote: The ring, like the outfit, is a self-assured choice, with three diamonds and no coloured stones. This differs from Diana\u2019s sapphire ring, worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, and Sarah Ferguson\u2019s ruby ring. The jewellery expert Susan Rumfitt says the ring, designed by Harry using two diamonds from Diana\u2019s collection and one from Botswana, fits with tradition. She compares it with the Queen\u2019s engagement ring from 1947, made using a stone from Prince Philip\u2019s mother\u2019s tiara. \u201cTo use a piece of family jewellery is a traditional idea,\u201d she said. The choice of diamonds, meanwhile, is both fashionable and traditional. Rumfitt said: The current fashion is for diamond engagement rings. But it\u2019s very traditional as well. Stephen Bates, formerly religious and royal correspondent of the Guardian, writes that Meghan Markle is not so different from royal brides in days of yore, and that the Windsors have become accustomed to the intrusive publicity that accompanies such events. Time moves on, and although we can expect much comment on Markle\u2019s acting career, her Americanness, mixed heritage, even before getting to speculation about how to become a first-time mother in your late 30s \u2013 such things are novel these days neither to most families, nor even to the royal family. It is thought that George III\u2019s long-suffering wife, Charlotte, who had a German background, may also have may have had mixed-race ancestry. And their son the Duke of Clarence \u2013 later William IV \u2013 lived with the Irish actor Dorothea Jordan for 20 years and had 10 children with her, until he was reminded that he might become king one day and if he wanted a royal pension he ought to find a more suitable wife. He ditched her for the minor German princess Adelaide, who was 30 years his junior ... Having an actor in the family is not the social stigma it was in old William IV\u2019s day either: Markle is sure to be a hot property for agents and producers across the world now, if she chooses to continue her career. And why not, though she may have to be a bit careful about the roles she chooses from now on. Prince Harry designed the ring that Markle showed off to photographers this afternoon, using diamonds that belonged to his mother, Princess Diana. The two outside stones came from the late princess\u2019s personal collection, with the centrepiece a large diamond from Botswana. The country holds special significance for Harry who has visited many times since he was a child and is a place where the couple have spent time together over the past year and a half, Kensington Palace said. The band is made of gold and the ring was made by Cleave and Company. By designing his bride-to-be\u2019s engagement ring using jewels that belonged to his mother, Harry is following in the footsteps of his grandfather. The Duke of Edinburgh designed an engagement ring for the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, in 1947. The Duke had the ring made by the jewellers Philip Antrobus Ltd, using diamonds from a tiara belonging to his mother, Princess Alice of Greece. When Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge, he gave her Diana\u2019s famous sapphire and diamond engagement ring. He hid the priceless heirloom in a rucksack so he could pop the question on holiday in Kenya. Will Meghan Markle, an American national, need to apply for a visa to join her soon-to-be spouse in the UK? Downing Street declined to comment to reporters who asked the question at this morning\u2019s lobby briefing and directed the question to the House Office. The Home Office \u201cdoes not comment on individual cases\u201d but pointed the Guardian towards the rules for family visas, which are needed if you wish to remain in the UK with your spouse or fiance. The decision is usually made within eight weeks and will cost \u00a3993, or \u00a31,583 if Meghan decides to use the premium service. There are restrictions, including if you cannot prove your knowledge of English or your spouse does not meet the minimum income requirement of \u00a318,000 or cash savings above \u00a316,000, but that is unlikely to be an issue for the couple. It is not clear which visa Meghan is currently using to be in the UK, but if she is here on a visitor visa, under the official system, she would need to leave the UK in order to apply for her family visa. Hysteria ensues. Meghan appeared for her first photocall as Harry\u2019s fiancee in a white coat by the Canadian brand Line the Label, as well as a dress by Parosh. Immediately after the appearance, Line the Label\u2019s website crashed because of the numbers of people trying to access its site. Still no word from Trump. He\u2019s sent three tweets in the last 45 minutes. Washington DC is five hours behind UK time. As previously discussed, the diplomatic course of action would be to congratulate them. But Markle did once call the president of the US \u201cmisogynistic\u201d. What will he do? Here\u2019s a few more pictures of the happy couple in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace: Here\u2019s a close up picture of the engagement ring \u2013 and it\u2019s a biggie. A large media crowd has gathered outside Kensington Palace, the dormitory for the younger royals, with royal fans also gathered politely out of the view of the cameras. At one point a cheer went up from a crowd gathered by the fence of the palace when the couple apparently appeared briefly in the grounds. Averil Edwards, from Chicago, and Melanie Edwards, from St Louis, were on their way to visit the palace\u2019s Princess Diana exhibit. \u201cI just found out ... it\u2019s exciting!\u201d Averil said. \u201cIt\u2019s great how he protected her too when all of the press controversy was going on,\u201d she added. Tony Appleton, from Chelmsford, Essex, was standing close to the TV crews in full town crier regalia, with a self-made scroll proclaiming the engagement: \u201cI had a little phone call this morning, very early. I can\u2019t disclose my source but I was up here outside the palace at 8am, had my scroll ready, to make the announcement. \u201cI did a cry outside Buckingham Palace about 9.30-10am, before I got told off by police.\u201d Ring update here from ITV\u2019s royal editor: The first pictures of Harry and Meghan\u2019s engagement photocall have landed. Here\u2019s a selection. Harry and Meghan have appeared for a photocall in the gardens of Kensington palace Dressed in a navy blue suit, Harry appeared holding Meghan\u2019s hand. She was dressed in a white overcoat. Assembled reporters shouted questions at the couple. Asked how he proposed, Harry replied: \u201cThat will come later.\u201d \u201cWas it romantic?\u201d another reporter asked. \u201cOf course it was,\u201d Harry said. He said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to be engaged, while Meghan said she was \u201cso very happy\u201d. Asked when he knew Meghan was \u201cthe one\u201d, he replied \u201cthe very first time\u201d they met. She was asked to show reporters the ring and obliged. Jonathan Munro, the BBC\u2019s head of newsgathering, has confirmed Harry and Meghan will be interviewed by Mishal Husain on behalf of all broadcasters, and it will air at 6pm. He has yet to tweet today, and the prolific social media ranter Donald Trump faces a dilemma. The diplomatic course of action, as the leader of Britain\u2019s closest ally, would be to congratulate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. However, the future princess has been critical of the US president, branding him \u201cmisogynistic\u201d. The prospect of Trump attending the ceremony is an unlikely one. With the level of protection that surrounds an American president, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event. Trump\u2019s appearance could also spark mass protests. When Theresa May offered Trump an early invite for a state visit, the decision proved controversial with polls suggesting up to two million people would take to the streets to demonstrate should the trip go ahead. In 2011, the then US president, Barack Obama, and the first lady, Michelle Obama, were not invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding, reportedly because of the added security cost. But they were feted with a state visit to the UK a month later. Should Trump travel to the UK for a state visit, it would be expected that the newly royal Markle would meet him and join guests at the state banquet. But Markle, who backed Hillary Clinton for president, suggested in a television interview in 2016 that she would leave the US for Canada if Trump won. She said: \u201cWe film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada. I mean come on, if that\u2019s reality we are talking about, come on, that is a gamechanger in terms of how we move in the world here.\u201d Markle told Larry Wilmore\u2019s Nightly Show in the US: \u201cYes, of course Trump is divisive. \u201cThink about just female voters alone. I think it was in 2012, the Republican party lost the female vote by 12 points. That\u2019s a huge number and as misogynistic as Trump is and so vocal about it, that\u2019s a huge chunk of it.\u201d For the 1981 wedding of Harry\u2019s parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, Ronald Reagan did not attend but his wife, Nancy Reagan, did. This could be an option for Harry, who has already met the current first lady, Melania Trump. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be expected to receive one of the sought-after invites, along with other Commonwealth leaders from across the globe. The UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wished Harry and Meghan well, after party members booed when reporters asked him about the engagement. After he gave a speech in Glasgow, Corbyn ignored the booing by activists and said: \u201cI wish them well, I hope they have a great time and great fun together, and having met Harry a couple of times I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to have a great deal of fun.\u201d Corbyn added: \u201cI really do admire the way that Harry and his brother have drawn attention to mental health conditions all across the country. \u201cI wish him well, thank him for what he has done on mental health, hope they have a great life together.\u201d Details of the venue and timing of the wedding are expected to be released on Tuesday with aides only saying it will be \u201ca happy church wedding\u201d. Harry is understood to have told his close staff two weeks ago that he wanted to make the engagement public today and planning has been under way since then. The couple got engaged this month in London. The delay in making the announcement was partly due to Markle needing to finish filming on Suits, which she did the week before last. The pair are due to give a broadcast interview this evening after posing for photos this afternoon outside Kensington Palace, where they will live in the two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage. You can share your joy at the royal engagement, or frustration at its domination of the news agenda, elsewhere on the Guardian website. Given that Markle is not a UK citizen, assuming the normal rules reply, she will have to get a visa to get married in Britain. The Press Association says: The rule is that all non-European nationals must obtain a visa if they want to come to the UK in order to marry. Markle could apply for a family visa if she wants to live with fiance Harry in the UK for more than six months. Fees range from \u00a3993 to \u00a31,583. Decisions by the Home Office can be made on the same day via the premium service or sometimes take up to 12 weeks. There is unlikely to be any hold-up for the future HRH. It also says that it is not a given that Markle will become a British citizen. When the Canadian Autumn Phillips married the Queen\u2019s grandson Peter Phillips, she said: \u2018I\u2019m happy being Canadian and I\u2019m proud of where I come from. So I\u2019ll keep my passport.\u2019 Their children, Savannah and Isla Phillips, are said to hold dual British and Canadian citizenship, which would pave the way for dual citizenship for any children Harry and his bride might have. Outside Buckingham Palace this morning hundreds of tourists were gathered for the changing of the guard, but news of the engagement had apparently not yet filtered through. Those present had to be told of the happy news. \u201cI\u2019m happy for him, that\u2019s about it really,\u201d said Deryck Toney, who was sightseeing while on holiday from Virginia. \u201cI think if he\u2019s in love with her and she\u2019s in love with him they should go on and be married and live a happy life.\u201d Jessica Parsons, from Los Angeles, and her friends looked up Harry and Meghan on Google before giving their opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting that he\u2019s engaged to an American, I think that\u2019s every American girl\u2019s dream,\u201d she said. \u201cNow there\u2019s hope for us Americans, for American girls,\u201d she added, but a friend quickly pointed out that the next eligible royal bachelor, Prince George, was some years away from an engagement. Francis Essel, from Ghana, said he was in the UK for the first time. He said he was enjoying the changing of the guard. Asked about Prince Harry\u2019s engagement, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know much about him.\u201d The one Briton the Guardian was able to find was a tour guide who had been showing Essel and others from his party the sights. \u201cPersonally I couldn\u2019t care less, but for my job I have to take an interest,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it will never be on the front page when there are so many other important things happening. I bet Theresa [May] will be pleased; we\u2019ve got a royal wedding as a distraction.\u201d Nevertheless, she said she had nothing against Harry, and it was a good thing that his marrying a mixed race woman would introduce a bit of diversity into the royal family. But, she added: \u201cHe\u2019s the spare anyway, he\u2019s not important. He\u2019s not even the spare now, he\u2019s way down the line.\u201d Republic, a campaign group calling for the abolition of the monarchy, put out a statement that, in its brevity, dripped with distain. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d Graham Smith of Republic said. The tributes are pouring in. The prime minister, Theresa May, says \u201cthis is a time of huge celebration for two people in love\u201d. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is likely to wed the couple, wished them \u201cmany years of love\u201d. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, took time out from exposing British citizens to increased jail terms overseas to offer \u201chuge congratulations\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, wished the pair a lifetime of happiness together. The former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, who will presumably be interested in American Markle\u2019s immigration status, also offered congratulations. Meghan Markle will become a duchess or princess after she weds Prince Harry, the Press Association reports. Tradition dictates that royal men receive a title when they marry, with Harry expected to become the Duke of Sussex. On the morning of his wedding, the prince is likely to be given a dukedom by his grandmother, the Queen. His new wife would become both an HRH and a duchess after saying her vows. But Harry \u2013 whose full name is Prince Henry of Wales \u2013 could turn down a title. In this case, Meghan would be known as HRH Princess Henry of Wales. She is not entitled to be Princess Meghan, though this may be how she becomes known in the media and to the public. It is likely that Harry will accept the Queen\u2019s offer of a dukedom as is the convention, like his brother, Prince William, who was made the Duke of Cambridge, and his uncle Prince Andrew, who became the Duke of York. Meghan Markle is an American actress best known for her role in the US TV series Suits. She rose to fame playing the law student Rachel Zane in the legal drama after parts in CSI: Miami, the sci-fi show Fringe and movies such as Remember Me and Horrible Bosses. The 36-year-old Californian is a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and campaigns for gender equality in her role as a women\u2019s advocate for the UN. She has her own clothing line and had a fashion and lifestyle website thetig.com. In her own words, she said she was \u201can actress, a writer, the editor-in-chief of my lifestyle brand The Tig, a pretty good cook, and a firm believer in handwritten notes\u201d. In what was seen as a sign of Markle getting ready to marry into the royals, she brought an abrupt end to her blog in April 2017. She removed all posts and closed the site, posting a message that began: \u201cAfter close to three beautiful years on this adventure with you, it\u2019s time to say goodbye to The Tig.\u201d But she gave no explanation as to why she had made her decision. In September 2017, her engagement to Harry looked set when she appeared on the cover of the US magazine Vanity Fair and talked about her relationship. \u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love,\u201d she said. She was born on 4 August 1981 to her clinical therapist mother, Doria Radlan, and her TV lighting director father, Thomas Markle. She grew up in Los Angeles, and studied at a girls\u2019 Roman Catholic college. Her parents divorced when she was six. Markle has written about her mixed heritage \u2013 her father is caucasian and of Dutch and Irish descent and her mother is African American \u2013 and how it created \u201ca grey area surrounding my self-identification\u201d. Markle graduated from Northwestern University in theatre and international relations. Markle\u2019s parents, Doria Radlan and Thomas Markle, wished their daughter and Harry \u201ca lifetime of happiness\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry. \u201cOur daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents.\u201d Harry\u2019s gran, the Queen, was one of the first to express her delight at the announcement. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh both said they were \u201cdelighted\u201d for their grandson and his bride-to-be, and \u201cwish them every happiness\u201d. His dad, Princes Charles, told reporters at a series of appearances in Dorset that the development was \u201cvery good\u201d and added: \u201cThrilled for them both. They\u2019ll be very happy indeed.\u201d Harry\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate, said: \u201cWe are very excited for Harry and Meghan. It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and to see how happy she and Harry are together.\u201d Welcome to live coverage of the announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are engaged. Clarence House revealed the betrothal in a brief statement. \u201cHis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms Meghan Markle,\u201d it said. Social media and news organisations exploded with joy, disdain, excitement and in some cases antipathy.",

          "bodyText": "The Australian parliament must commit to deliver marriage equality by Christmas, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said after an \u201cunequivocal, overwhelming\u201d vote of 61.6% in favour of same-sex marriage in an unprecedented national postal survey. As nationwide celebrations heralded a result that will give enormous momentum to a final push to achieve the historic social reform, Turnbull moved to head off attempts from conservatives in his ruling Liberal-National Coalition to frustrate or delay the legislative process. Turnbull said the survey \u2013 which had a participation rate of 79.5% \u2013 meant Australians had \u201cspoken in their millions and they have voted overwhelmingly yes for marriage equality\u201d. \u201cThey voted yes for fairness, yes for commitment, yes for love. And now it is up to us here in the parliament of Australia to get on with it, to get on with the job the Australian people asked us to do and get this done,\u201d he said. After a national vote that was resisted at every turn by marriage equality advocates who viewed it as an affront because it determined the right to equality before the law by a majoritarian vote, prominent LGBTI Australians celebrated that the Australian values of fairness and equality were reflected in the outcome. Large public gatherings in major cities, including Sydney and Melbourne, saw marriage proposals, tears and the popping of champagne corks as Australia\u2019s chief statistician, David Kalisch, announced the result in the capital, Canberra. In Melbourne 5,000 people outside the State Library of Victoria cheered and danced to Kylie Minogue. In Sydney\u2019s Prince Alfred Park, John Paul Young sang Love Is in the Air. The swimming champion Ian Thorpe, the actor Magda Szubanski, the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, and the Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, were among those overcome with emotion and keen to share their joy with fellow Australians. Celebrities including Minogue, Ellen DeGeneres \u2013 married to Australian-American Portia de Rossi \u2013 the Apple boss, Tim Cook, the Canadian leader, Justin Trudeau, and former British prime minister David Cameron tweeted congratulations. For Hannah Collins and Heather Ford, there was no time to waste. When Kalisch finally announced that the yes campaign had secured 61.6% of the vote in Australia\u2019s voluntary same-sex marriage postal survey, Ford proposed. \u201cHeather got down on her knee, mate, and the date is 4 April,\u201d Collins said. Christine Forster, the sister of the former prime minister Tony Abbott \u2013 she is in a same-sex relationship and is a long-term supporter of marriage equality, while he is an opponent \u2013 punched the air. Szubanski said the result was for \u201call of us\u201d. \u201cNo matter how we want to live our life, we must live as equal people in this country,\u201d she told the crowd in Sydney. In Melbourne Andrew Doherty said he could finally plan the beach wedding he\u2019s always dreamed of. He proposed to his partner of three years before the postal vote result announcement on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not happy we had to have this vote but I\u2019m happy we have the opportunity to change things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident Australia has woken up but I\u2019m not confident the politicians have, especially given these bills proposed to embed discrimination.\u201d Every state and territory voted for marriage equality, with the national vote 7,817,247 in favour and 4,873,947 against. The constituencies of central Sydney and Melbourne saw the largest majorities in favour, at 83.7% each. Seventeen of the federal parliament\u2019s 150 seats had a majority of no voters, including a conspicuous swath of western Sydney, a socially conservative and ethnically diverse area. Crowds gathered in cities across Australia \u2013 at 7am in Perth, and in the rain in Adelaide. \u201cAbsolute elation\u201d was reported in Brisbane. At a press conference in Canberra, Wong said: \u201cThank you Australia, thank you for standing up for fairness, thank you for standing up for equality \u2026 for the LGBTI community everywhere \u2026 for the sort of Australia we believe in, that is decent, that is fair, which is accepting, which turns its back on exclusion and division.\u201d At a rally in Melbourne the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, promised: \u201cToday we celebrate, tomorrow we legislate. \u201cIt may have been 61% who voted yes in the survey, but I want to say to all LGBTQI Australians, you are 100% loved, 100% valued and, after the next two weeks of parliament, 100% able to marry the person you love,\u201d he said. In a speech after the result an Equality Campaign spokesman, Alex Greenwich, said: \u201cToday love has had a landslide victory. Together we have achieved something truly remarkable, a win for fairness and equality, not only for the LGBTI community and our families, but for all Australians.\u201d Greenwich said the campaign had made more than 1m phone calls and knocked on 100,000 doors, an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of support that had exceeded \u201cany campaign in our history\u201d. \u201cIn doing so it has delivered an unequivocal mandate to federal parliament to vote this through by the end of the year,\u201d he said. Turnbull, same-sex marriage supporters in Australia\u2019s ruling Coalition, the Labor opposition, the Greens and other crossbench parties have reached a consensus around a cross-party bill that makes minimalist changes to protect religious freedom without legalising discrimination by commercial service providers, such as cake makers \u2013 as some conservatives in the Coalition government have demanded. On Wednesday afternoon the cross-party group capitalised on the mandate in the survey by introducing the bill and a motion that will lead to it being debated until it is passed in the sitting week beginning 27 November. Conservatives including Abbott and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, have foreshadowed that they will back amendments in parliament while other government MPs have said they will abstain if they don\u2019t get their way on religious protections. But the cross-party group has sufficient numbers to legislate marriage equality, provided that Turnbull\u2019s position that parliament will determine which bill to use and amendments to make holds. The cross-party group were boosted when an alternative bill, by the Liberal senator James Paterson, was withdrawn, with Paterson conceding it had no chance of becoming law. Same-sex marriage has been banned in Australia since 2004 when the Howard government changed the Marriage Act to define marriage as between a man and a woman. As many comparable countries such as the US and Britain allowed or legislated for same-sex marriage, Australia looked increasingly out of step. After the successful marriage equality referendum in Ireland in May 2015, pressure grew on the Australian government to legislate but the Coalition party room agreed on a national plebiscite instead. When Turnbull took the prime ministership from Abbott in September 2015, he retained the Coalition\u2019s commitment to hold a national plebiscite on same-sex marriage before changing the law. Opposition parties blocked an compulsory attendance plebiscite, leading the Turnbull government to launch a $122m voluntary national postal survey to fulfil its election commitment to give Australians a say. In a bruising three-month campaign, opponents of marriage equality claimed same-sex marriage would have far-reaching negative consequences for gender education, religious freedom and freedom of speech. The yes camp\u2019s Equality Campaign combined with moderate Liberals, Labor, the Greens, unions and the progressive campaign organisation GetUp to argue that same-sex marriage was a matter of equality, fairness and allowing LGBTI Australians to marry the one they love. Despite assertions from Turnbull that the survey would be overwhelmingly respectful, the campaign has been marred by homophobic incidents and campaign material, which continued largely unabated despite a special law passed to apply electoral law safeguards to the survey. The no campaign took increasingly bizarre turns, with Abbott using an assault that even his attacker said had nothing to do with marriage to rally Australians to his cause, and conservatives attempting to use the US rapper Macklemore\u2019s performance of his hit Same Love at the rugby league grand final to claim the national campaign they called for had inappropriately politicised Australian institutions.",

The remaining 11 countries, including Japan, Australia, Mexico and Malaysia, said they had revived the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, a multilateral agreement championed under the Obama administration. Ministers meeting in Danang, Vietnam agreed on the \u201ccore elements\u201d of what was now called the comprehensive and progressive agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a joint statement read. It said that the ministers maintained \u201cthe high standards, overall balance and integrity of the TPP while ensuring the commercial and other interests of all participants and preserving our inherent right to regulate, including the flexibility of the parties to set legislative and regulatory priorities.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Vietnam\u2019s trade minister, Tran Tuan Anh, said the ministers had \u201creached an agreement on a number of fundamental parts.\u201d He said the ministers had \u201covercome the hardest part\u201d. It was not clear if the countries\u2019 leaders would formally endorse the agreement or when it would be implemented.

Japan and Australia had lobbied hard for the agreement, which aims to eliminate trading barriers and tariffs on industrial and farm products across the 11-nation bloc whose trade totalled $356bn last year. Rescuing the pact, which had appeared moribund after Trump ditched it two days after being sworn into the presidency, was not a certainty. Negotiating leaders had agreed to meet on Friday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) conference in Vietnam. But an empty seat reserved for Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, led to accusations that he had reneged. Canadian trade minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, blamed \u201ca misunderstanding about the schedule\u201d for Trudeau\u2019s absence while adding that auto sector and cultural protection were areas needing more work. As the second biggest economy among remaining TPP countries after Japan, Canada had said it wanted to ensure an agreement that would protect jobs. \u201cThere is a lot of work left to be done but I think we have made good progress today,\u201d Champagne told reporters in Vietnam late on Friday. Saturday\u2019s statement said a \u201climited set of provisions\u201d from the original deal would be suspended, adding further technical work was needed on four areas that still needed consensus \u201cto prepare finalised text for signature\u201d. It did not say when that might happen.

While the statement still referred to free and open trade, it also mentioned fair trade and called for members to improve \u201cadherence to rules agreed upon.\u201d Australia will still walk away from the Apec summit with a free trade pact with Peru that will eliminate nearly all tariffs exporters face into the Latin American country.

But we have settled for two detailed examples: one relating to Queen Elizabeth II and the other to an adviser of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.

However, a gun massacre in a smalltown Texas church, not long after a truck attack killed several cyclists in New York City, highlighted the US\u2019s current vulnerabilities at the hands of violent extremists.</p> <p>In Saudi Arabia, a purge of senior establishment figures by the young reformist crown prince Salman has sent shockwaves through the secretive kingdom and sent seasoned Middle East watchers scrambling to predict what comes next.</p> <p>From east Asia comes a fascinating tale of wartime shipwreck salvage, desecrating the sea graves of many fallen soldiers and prompting much speculation about why such historic scrap metal should suddenly be of such international value.</p> <p>In the UK, the news has been dominated by a deepening sexual abuse scandal engulfing Westminster MPs that has resulted in resignations, suspensions and investigations on all sides, and has brought much parliamentary business to a standstill.

          "bodyText": "From Panama to Paradise: as the latest leak of 13.4m files from an offshore financial services provider underlines, the world\u2019s super-rich continue to benefit from ever-ingenious ways of sheltering their wealth from national taxation. It has taken 381 reporters from 67 countries around a year to sift through this massive data haul, which was obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with 96 media partners, including the Guardian. The results have generated more than enough material to fill this week\u2019s Guardian Weekly in its entirety. But we have settled for two detailed examples: one relating to Queen Elizabeth II and the other to an adviser of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. The full trove of Paradise Papers stories, which are still being released, can be found here on the Guardian\u2019s website. Donald Trump began an extensive Asia-Pacific tour hoping to put his domestic woes behind him. However, a gun massacre in a smalltown Texas church, not long after a truck attack killed several cyclists in New York City, highlighted the US\u2019s current vulnerabilities at the hands of violent extremists. In Saudi Arabia, a purge of senior establishment figures by the young reformist crown prince Salman has sent shockwaves through the secretive kingdom and sent seasoned Middle East watchers scrambling to predict what comes next. From east Asia comes a fascinating tale of wartime shipwreck salvage, desecrating the sea graves of many fallen soldiers and prompting much speculation about why such historic scrap metal should suddenly be of such international value. In the UK, the news has been dominated by a deepening sexual abuse scandal engulfing Westminster MPs that has resulted in resignations, suspensions and investigations on all sides, and has brought much parliamentary business to a standstill. We bring you the background to a crisis that could change the way UK politics is done for good. Last week saw the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, a statement that first offered Britain\u2019s support for \u201cthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\u201d. Our Weekly Review long read takes a detailed look at the historical and present-day context to an anniversary that, not surprisingly, sharply divides opinion to this day. Discovery takes a critical look at the rise of artificial intelligence and a worrying drain of academic experts in this field to the megabucks private-sector world of Silicon Valley. As South Africa\u2019s ANC approaches elections to decide its new leader \u2013 and by extension almost certainly the country\u2019s next president \u2013 the Books reviews consider how the party has never fully filled the leadership void created when Nelson Mandela stepped down. The Culture pages look into the interminably low-speed world of performance artist Tehching Hsieh, while the reviews pick up the Netflix TV series Stranger Things 2, currently the subject of an epic binge-watching marathon in the Snowdon household. I have to admit part of the appeal of Stranger Things is the way it beautifully captures the low-tech, big hair innocence of my childhood (now long gone, as a quick glance at my Guardian profile picture will testify). But it also reminds me how much dark background politics were going on, of which we were only partly aware at the time.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are top stories this morning. A huge leak of more than 13m files has revealed how some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people and biggest businesses \u2013 including the Queen and Trump cabinet members \u2013 have used secretive tax havens to protect their fortunes. The cache, known as the Paradise Papers, has come from two offshore service providers and the company registries of 19 tax havens. It was obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with partners including the Guardian. The documents show how: the Queen\u2019s estate has invested in a Cayman Islands fund; the shipping group of Trump commerce secretary Wilbur Ross received payments from a firm co-owned by Vladimir Putin\u2019s son-in-law; a $450m offshore trust has sheltered the wealth of Lord Ashcroft; Twitter and Facebook have received hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from Russian state institutions; a close adviser of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau moved millions offshore; and Bono used a Malta-based firm to buy a shopping centre in Lithuania. Although the schemes are legal, the details will increase pressure on political leaders to act. Theresa May and Donald Trump have both pledged to curb tax avoidance, a practice estimated to see $600bn in profits moved offshore each year. The law firm at the centre of the leak, Appleby, which has operations in havens such as Bermuda, the Caymans, Jersey and Guernsey, says it has investigated all the allegations and found \u201cthere is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients\u201d. The release of the papers provoked an angry reaction in the UK and around the world. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it showed there was \u201cone rule for the rich and another for the rest\u201d, while US Democrats called for an inquiry into Ross\u2019s Russia links. For a more in-depth explanation of the leak you can watch our video explainer and also read about why \u2013 18 months after the huge Panama Papers leak \u2013 we are once again shining a light on tax avoidance. * * * Texas shooting kills 26 \u2013 A lone gunman has killed at least 26 people and injured 20 in an attack on a church in rural Texas \u2013 the latest gun rampage to hit the United States. The man, named locally as former air force serviceman 26-year-old Devin Kelley, approached the First Baptist church in Sutherland Springs near San Antonio at 11.20am on Sunday morning and opened fire with an automatic weapon. Dressed in black, combat-style clothing and a ballistic vest, he then entered the church and continued shooting. His victims were aged between five and 72, police said. A local person tackled him as he left the church but he managed to flee in a car. The gunman was later found dead in his wrecked vehicle although it is not clear exactly what caused his death. The Texas shooting, which follows the deaths of 58 people at a festival in Las Vegas in October, was the worst such incident in the state\u2019s modern history, governor Greg Abbott said. President Donald Trump, who is visiting Japan, said it was an \u201cact of evil\u201d but that America would \u201cstand strong\u201d. To read more, here is what we know so far and you can follow developments in Texas at our live blog here. * * * More MPs under investigation \u2013 Government whip Chris Pincher has become the seventh Conservative MP to be caught up in allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The MP for Tamworth has \u201cvoluntarily stood down\u201d from the whips\u2019 office and referred himself to the party\u2019s complaints procedure after a complaint was received, No 10 said on Sunday night.

He turned himself in to Belgian police on Sunday but was released pending a further court ruling on whether to execute the European arrest warrant issued by Spain, local TV reported. * * * Stop strep \u2013 The deaths of more than 100,000 babies could be prevented by the development of a vaccine against group B streptococcus (GBS), an infection commonly carried by pregnant women.

The Mail says the monarch has been \u201cdragged\u2019\u201d into a \u00a310m offshore tax row. The Mirror splashes with the story as well and calls it a \u201cscandal\u201d with one Labour MP calling the news of the Queen\u2019s offshore investments as \u201cshameful\u201d. The i follows suit and also makes mention of stories involving Bono and Lord Ashcroft. The Times also plays it straight saying \u201cQueen invested millions in offshore tax havens\u201d. The Guardian devotes its entire front page to the papers. The Sun splashes on the latest in the scandal rocking Westminster. It discusses allegations that \u201cextreme\u201d pornography was found on one of deputy prime minister Damian Green\u2019s Commons computers, a claim he has denied. The Telegraph also leads on the scandal saying it will \u201cclear out ministers\u201d. Lastly the FT splashes with the news of the extraordinary arrests of Saudi princes and tycoons at the behest of the new crown prince.
