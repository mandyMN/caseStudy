* Q_script.py contains the JustinTrudeau_InfoClass which is enclosing the entire logic. 
* Each function is meant to solve either partially or entirely one of the 8 questions.
* The execution of the logic is done by running the execute.py script, please find the indepth comments within the code.
* The results/answers are contained in folder JustinTrudeau/Q_'number or the question from the case study'

* The last request was implemented using a cron job within Jenkins that runs the Q_script.py every day at 8:00am and updates the graphical analysis of the evolution in the number of articles. See JustinTrudeau/Q5.
